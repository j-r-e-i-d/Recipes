This is the pancake I will be making on Pancake Day 2021. It’s a new recipe, inspired by my Baltic travels. Hemp seeds are very popular in Latvia and full of goodness (and naturally occurring, feel-good [CBD](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/cannabidiol-cbd-what-we-know-and-what-we-dont-2018082414476)). They are a wonderful flavour match for ripe pear. The addition of twaróg (you can use any curd cheese or even cream cheese) imparts them with a moreish creaminess.

*makes 3 large pancakes*

## Ingredients 
1 pear, peeled and diced

150g plain flour

pinch of salt

1/2 teaspoon baking powder

1 egg, separated

125ml milk

1 tablespoon kefir (or yoghurt)

rapeseed/canola oil for frying

1 tablespoon hemp seeds, toasted – to serve

good quality honey – to serve

* Place the flour, baking powder and salt in a large bowl and mix to combine.
* Beat the egg white to soft peaks.
* Add the egg yolk to the flour, pour in the milk and stir until there are no lumps. Add a splash of the rapeseed oil too.
* Break the twaróg into small bits and add to the mixture (or just stir in the cream cheese thoroughly).
* Fold the beaten egg whites into the large bowl and stir gently to combine.
* Start heating up the rapeseed oil in frying pan.
* Add the pear chunks to the batter.
* Once the oil is hot individually fry your pancakes in it, for about 3 minutes each side. Drain on kitchen paper.
* Serve sprinkled with hemp seeds and drizzled with honey.
