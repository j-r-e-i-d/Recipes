Serves 4

## Ingredients

* Cream cheese, light, 250 g
* Ricotta cheese, reduced fat, 500 g, fresh if possible
* Honey, 1 tablespoon(s)
* Vanilla essence, 2 teaspoon(s)
* Fromage frais, reduced fat, 300 g, or strawberry flavoured or low-fat yoghurt
* Blueberries, 250 g
* Sponge finger biscuit, 2 biscuit(s), crumbled

## Method
Place the cream cheese, ricotta, honey and vanilla in a large bowl. Using an electric hand-held mixer, beat on high speed until smooth and well combined. Fold in the fromage frais or yoghurt and half the blueberries.

Divide half the remaining blueberries among four 250 ml glass tumblers. Top evenly with the cream-cheese mixture and sprinkle over the biscuit crumbs. Scatter over the remaining blueberries and serve immediately.

NOTES: These cheesecakes can be made up to 1 day ahead of time; just cover and keep chilled until you are ready to serve; adding the biscuit crumbs just before serving.
