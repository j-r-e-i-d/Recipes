## Ingredients
* 250 g plain full fat Greek Yogurt
* 250 g self raising flour 
* Oil for rolling out

## Instructions
* Mix the Greek yogurt and flour together in a large bowl, then leave to rest for 20 minutes at room temperature.
* Divide the dough into 8 and roll into 8 balls.
* Heat a small non-stick frying pan over a high heat and roll out your first flatbread to about the side of a side plate â€“ use a little oil on the work surface to stop the dough sticking.
* When the pan is really hot, lay the flatbread in the pan and cook for 20 seconds, or until the flatbread is covered in brown spots (but not burnt!!)
* Flip the flatbread over and cook on the other side for a further 20 seconds, or until covered in brown spots and cooked through.
* While the first flatbread is cooking, roll out the second flatbread so it is ready.
* Put the cooked flatbread on a plate and repeat the process, until all the flatbreads are cooked.
