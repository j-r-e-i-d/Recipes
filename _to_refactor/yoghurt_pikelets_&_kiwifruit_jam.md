We always focus on the pavlova as the great battleground between Australian and New Zealand cuisine, but it could just as easily be the pikelet. Originally adapted from Scottish drop scones, just like the pavlova it’s likely the pikelet came first from New Zealand as a delicious contrast to thin British-style pancakes. Matched with a bit of kiwifruit jam, it’s a classic New Zealand afternoon tea.

## Ingredients
**Kiwifruit jam**

* **1 kg** kiwifruit flesh
* **3** lemons, juiced
* **125 ml** (½ cup) water
* **330 g** (1½ cups) caster sugar

**Yoghurt pikelets**

* **1** egg
* **1½ tbsp** caster sugar
* **360 g** (1½ cups) natural yoghurt
* **150 g** (1 cup) plain flour
* **1 tsp** bicarbonate of soda
* **a few tbsp** milk (optional)
* **20 g** melted butter, plus extra for brushing
* clotted cream, to serve

## Instructions
**Resting time** 30 minutes

For the kiwifruit jam, place the flesh of the kiwifruit and lemon juice in saucepan set over medium-high heat. Cook for 10 minutes, then add the water and sugar, and stir to dissolve. Simmer for a further 25 minutes until a jam-like consistency, stirring occasionally. Fill sterilised jars and allow to cool completely. Store in the fridge for up to 2 months. Makes about 750 ml (3 cups).

To make the pikelets, whisk the egg, sugar and yoghurt in a bowl until smooth. Sift the flour and bicarbonate of soda into the bowl, and fold gently until just combined. Depending on the thickness of the yoghurt you can add a few tablespoons of milk for a thinner batter. Cover with a tea towel and rest in the fridge for 30 minutes. Gently fold in the melted butter.

Place a large, non-stick frying pan set over medium-low heat. In batches, lightly brush the pan with melted butter. Spoon 2 tablespoons of the batter per pikelet into the pan. Cook for 2 minutes each side or until golden and cooked through. This recipe makes about 12 pikelets.

Serve the pikelets with the kiwifruit jam and clotted cream.
