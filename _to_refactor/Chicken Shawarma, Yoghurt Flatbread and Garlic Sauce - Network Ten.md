## Steps

-   For the Pickled Red Onion, combine ingredients in a bowl and toss to coat well. Set aside to soften for a minimum of two hours. Drain well to serve.
-    For the Spicy Chicken Thigh, place cumin and black peppercorns into a small frypan and toast until fragrant, approximately 30 seconds. Using a mortar and pestle, grind to a fine powder.  Place into a bowl and add the remaining ingredients and mix well until chicken is evenly coated. Set aside in the fridge to marinade for a minimum of 1 hour or overnight if desired.
-    Place a griddle pan on high heat. Once smoking hot, add the chicken and cook until charred, and chicken is cooked through. Remove from the heat, cover loosely with foil and allow to rest for at least 5 minutes. To serve, slice the chicken into 1 cm slices sprinkle with flaky sea salt and a drizzle of lemon juice.
-    For the Yoghurt Flatbread, place all ingredients into a large bowl and stir to combine into a rough dough.
-    Roll out onto a lightly floured surface and knead to a smooth dough. Portion into 8 even sized rounds, cover with a tea towel and allow to rest for at least 10 minutes.
-    Roll out each portion of dough out to 15-20cm diameter or the size of a small side plate.
-    Heat a non-stick pan over medium heat and drizzle with olive oil or ghee. Cook each round of dough for 2-3 minutes on each side until slightly golden and cooked through. Add additional oil or ghee to the pan as required.
-    Set aside between 2 clean tea towels until ready to serve.
-    For the Mixed Herb Salad, combine the mixed herbs in a bowl and set aside in the fridge. Just before serving, toss through olive oil and lemon juice to coat. Add a pinch of salt to season.
-    For the Toum, place the egg white, lemon juice, garlic and salt into a mini food processor. Blend together Place the stick blender in the very bottom of the jug and turn it on.  Leave the stick mixer going at the bottom of the cup until the mixture starts to turn white and fluffy.  Slowly, draw the blender upwards.  By the time the blended reaches the top of the mixture it will be white and fluffy. Set aside in the fridge until ready to serve.
-    To serve, spoon Toum on flatbread and top with some chicken strips and herb salad.
