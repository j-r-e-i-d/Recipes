"Racuchy is a traditional Polish dish from the same family of foods as the crêpe and similar to American pancakes. Racuchy is made from some flour,milk, eggs, sugar and a pinch of salt. Racuchy are made with yeast or, in other versions, baking powder or baking soda is used. Rauchy are pan fried in oil. In Poland racuchy are usually eaten as dinner, snack or supper."

## Ingredients:

* 2 whole eggs
* 1 cup buttermilk
* 250 g plain flour
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* salt
* oil for frying
* apples, pealed, cored and sliced in 1 cm slices

Beat eggs with the buttermilk and add all the dry Ingredients - flour, baking powder and salt. You're aiming for batter thicker than the one for pancakes, so it would stick to the apple slices. Heat the oil on the biggest frying pan you have. Dip your apple slices in the batter to cover it very well and place on hot oil. Fry on both sides until lightly browned. As there's no sugar in the batter, sprinkle generously with icing sugar before serving. Racuchy are great warm or cold.
