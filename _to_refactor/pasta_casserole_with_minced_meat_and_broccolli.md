# [Pasta Casserole With Minced Meat and Broccolli](https://fotokulinarnie.pl/przepisy/zapiekanka-makaronowa-z-miesem-mielonym-i-brokulami)

Delicious, quick and simple pasta casserole with minced meat and broccoli. It is really instant and very full-bodied - a perfect dinner proposition combining pasta, meat and vegetables. I believe that this taste will delight everyone, because it surprised me - I knew it would be good, but I didn't think it would taste so good for me! :)

I think that the broccoli casserole with pasta and meat is also a great way to smuggle broccoli for dinner - I'm sure that every opponent of this vegetable will like it in this form;)

## Ingredients
-   500 g of beef, minced
-   1 large onion
-   2 cloves of garlic
-   1 teaspoon of salt
-   1/2 teaspoon of pepper
-   1/2 teaspoon of thyme
-   1/4 teaspoon of Provencal herbs
-   1 tablespoon of tomato paste
-   1 tablespoon of olive oil
-   1 broccoli
-   250 g penne (or other short) pasta
-   120 g of yellow cheddar cheese

BECHAMEL SAUCE
-   25 g of butter
-   15 g of flour
-   350 ml of milk
-   1 teaspoon of salt
-   1/2 teaspoon of pepper
-   a pinch of nutmeg

TO GREASE THE MOLD
-   1/2 teaspoon of butter

## Method
Peel and chop the onion. Squeeze the garlic through a press or chop finely

In a pan, fry the onion with garlic in olive oil for a moment. After a while, add the meat, season with pepper, salt, Provencal herbs, thyme and a tablespoon of tomato paste and fry for about 10 minutes. If the meat is dry and the concentrate is too thick, add a tablespoon of water

Meanwhile, cook the pasta al dente

Also meanwhile divide the broccoli into small florets and put it in boiling salted water for literally 1 to 2 minutes, then strain

Prepare the Béchamel sauce: melt the butter in a pot, add flour and fry until golden brown. Then slowly add the milk, stirring vigorously and spread the sauce until a smooth consistency, without any lumps.

Season with salt, pepper, scoop and heat for another 1 to 2 minutes, stirring constantly, so that the sauce does not burn. Put the pot off the fire. For this dish, the sauce is supposed to be quite thin, so you can add a little more milk if needed

When the pasta, meat and broccoli are ready, add the pasta and broccoli to the pan with the meat and mix the whole thing

Put everything into a casserole dish lightly greased with butter and pour the béchamel sauce evenly over it

On the top of the casserole, coarsely grate the cheese and spread it evenly

Put in an oven preheated to 190 ° C and bake for 20 minutes - until the cheese is browned. If it blushes poorly, you can turn on hot air at the end

-   Serve the ready casserole hot
