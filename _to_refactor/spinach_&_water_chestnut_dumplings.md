One of the most versatile foods in Hong Kong, this steamed dumpling recipe tastes just as great if you wish to use a different folding or cooking Method to make pot stickers, wontons, shui jiao, and even gyoza.

## Ingredients

2 tbsp soy sauce
1½ tsp Chinese cooking wine
2 tbsp sesame oil
ground white pepper, to taste
1 tsp olive oil  
1 tbsp grated ginger
200 g canned, drained water chestnuts, finely chopped
250 g baby spinach, finely chopped  
2 tbsp cornflour mixed with 2 tbsp water
25–30 vegan dumpling wrappers

**To serve**
light soy sauce
finely chopped chilli
coriander leaves

## Instructions
Cooling time: 20 minutes

Combine the soy sauce, cooking wine, sesame oil and a pinch of pepper in a bowl.
Heat the oil in a large non–stick frying pan over medium heat. Add the ginger and stir for 1 minute or until fragrant, then add the water chestnut and stir for another minute. Add the spinach, increase the heat to high and stir until wilted. Add the combined sauces and cook for another minute. Add the cornflour mixture and cook for another minute or until thickened. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool.
To assemble the dumplings, fill a small bowl with water for dipping your finger into. Place 1 teaspoon of filling in the centre of a wrapper. Dip one finger in water, wet the edges and fold over to form a triangle. Gently press out and bubbles and seal the triangle. Wet one of the bottom corners of the triangle and bring the two corners together and seal. Repeat with the remaining wrappers and filling.
