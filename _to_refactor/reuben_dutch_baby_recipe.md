This Dutch baby is great for breakfast; sub out pastrami for roasted veggies to make this recipe vegetarian. Check out [step-by-step photo here](http://www.bonappetit.com/story/savory-dutch-baby-reuben-sandwich).

## Preparation

Real Talk: The key to getting a big, light, puffy rise is to make sure the flour is thoroughly incorporated into the egg mixture. Whisk your arm off until zero, absolutely zero, clumps remain.

Place a 10" cast-iron skillet in oven; preheat to 425°. Whisk eggs, milk, and 1 tsp. mustard in a medium bowl until smooth. Whisking constantly, gradually add flour, whisking until smooth; season with salt. Stir in half of cheese and ½ tsp. pepper.

Carefully remove preheated skillet from oven and add butter; swirl skillet to coat. Drape half of pastrami into skillet (it’s okay if it bends and folds over itself); season with salt and pepper. Pour egg mixture over. Return skillet to oven and bake until Dutch baby is puffed and golden brown, 12–15 minutes.

Remove skillet from oven and heat broiler ([do not fear the broiler](http://www.bonappetit.com/test-kitchen/how-to/article/how-to-broil/)). Drape remaining pastrami over Dutch baby; top with remaining 2 oz. cheese. Broil until cheese is melted, about 3 minutes.

Top with sauerkraut and mustard before serving.
