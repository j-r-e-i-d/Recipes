-   3cm galangal, peeled and roughly chopped
-   5 cloves garlic peeled
-   2cm young ginger, roughly chopped

### Celeriac Steak

-   1 large celeriac
-   1 tbsp oil
-   100g butter
-   250 ml vegetable stock
-   4 strips lemon peel

### Crispy Garnishes

-   300ml grapeseed oil
-   2 tbsp ikan bilis
-   2 sprigs curry leaves

## Steps

-   Preheat fan forced oven to 180oC. Prepare coals for a hibachi, if using.
-   For the Sambal Belacan, wrap belacan in foil and toast in the oven for 20 minutes. Place the chillies into a bowl and cover with boiling water to soften, about 10 minutes.
-   Remove belacan from the oven and place into a food processor.
-   Add the drained chillies and remaining ingredients and process to achieve a smooth paste.
-   Heat wok over high heat and fry paste until aromatic and caramelised, about 10-15 minutes. Stir regularly to ensure it doesn't catch and burn. Oil should rise to the surface and thicken to a rich paste. Season with palm sugar and fish sauce to achieve a sweet and salty flavour. Transfer to a bowl and set aside to cool.
-   For the Celeriac Steaks, peel celeriac and trim off ends. Cut into 4 x 2.5-3cm steaks. Season generously with salt and pepper.
-   Heat oil in a heavy based, oven safe frypan over high heat. Add the oil then celeriac steaks. Cook to brown on each side for 2 minutes.
-   Add the butter and lemon peel and spoon over the celeriac for 1 -2 minutes on each side. Pour in vegetable stock and bring to the boil. Transfer to the oven and baste every 10-15 minutes until just cooked through, about 30-35 minutes. Remove from the oven.
-   Heat a grill pan over medium high heat, if using. Transfer steaks to the hot grill pan or hibachi and cook, glazing with pan juices and turning regularly. Continue to cook until well charred. Transfer steaks to serving plates and cover to keep warm.
-   For the Crispy Garnishes, heat the oil in a deep saucepan to 180oC.
-   Add the ikan bilis and fry until golden. Transfer to paper towel to cool.
-   Carefully add the curry leaves to the hot oil and cook until just starting to become translucent, about 30 seconds. Transfer to paper towel to cool.
-   To serve, top each celeriac steak with 2-3 tablespoons of sambal and garnish with crispy ikan bilis and curry leaves.
