Use your imagination to jazz up a humble breakfast staple. Sweet, savoury, cooked with different grains, cooked with stock, flavoured with syrups, fruit, veggies vegies and proteins – the options are limitless. It's vegan, friendly, healthy and makes for a super tasty breakfast. Though it's traditionally a winter warmer, we like it at any time of year, using seasonal fruit.

## Ingredients
**For porridge**

2 carrots

1 granny smith apple

1 orange, zested

180g rolled oats

pinch of salt

400ml almond milk

1 knob fresh ginger

1 tbsp almonds, roasted and chopped

1 tbsp pepitas, roasted

**For fruit, winter spices and honey**

1 apple

1 pear

1 orange

2 rhubarb sticks, roughly chopped

80g honey

1 cinnamon stick

2 star anise

1 knob ginger, sliced

1 knob turmeric**, sliced

pinch salt

## Method
**For porridge**

If you have a juicer*, wash and juice the carrots and apple.

Set the orange zest aside then juice the orange.

Put the oats into a saucepan with the carrot, apple and orange juice (about 400ml total), add a pinch of salt, bring to the boil then reduce to a simmer.

Add 350ml almond milk and simmer for 8 to 10 minutes or until the porridge is soft and creamy, then add the orange zest and grate in some fresh ginger. Give it a final stir and adjust the texture with the remaining milk if needed.

Serve in a bowl topped with the roasted nuts, seeds and winter fruits with a little extra almond milk.

* **Tip:** If you don't have a juicer, you can use bought apple and carrot juice. Adding the orange zest and grated ginger at the end keeps the fresh zing of the zest and controls the heat of the ginger. The roasted nuts give the dish texture and with the roasted fruits you're set for the morning.

**For fruit**

Wash the apple and pear then cut into wedges and slices, removing seeds and cores but leaving the skins on for maximum flavour.

Cut half the orange into wedges, leaving the skin on.

Preheat the oven to 200C.

Heat the honey, cinnamon and star anise in a large non-stick pan until the honey becomes slightly darker. Add the fruits, rhubarb, ginger and turmeric carefully, as the hot honey can spit. Coat them well in the honey mix then transfer to a baking tray and roast for 10 minutes.

Remove from the oven, squeeze over the juice from the remaining orange half, sprinkle over a pinch of salt and serve with the porridge.

* ***Tip:** If you can find fresh turmeric, it is worth getting your hands on. If you don't have fresh turmeric or ginger, add a small pinch of the powdered stuff.
