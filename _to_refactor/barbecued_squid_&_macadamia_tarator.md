Whole, local BBQ calamari served atop finger lime pearls and a creamy tarator puree of macadamia, sourdough and chardonnay vinegar.

## Ingredients

* 120 g saltbush leaves
* 600 g whole local calamari, cleaned, tentacles reserved
* 120 g finger limes, split and pearls removed

Macadamia tarator

* 150 g macadamias
* 1 slice sourdough baguette (about 25 g), crust removed
* 30 ml extra-virgin olive oil
* 3 tsp chardonnay vinegar
* ½ tsp sea salt flakes
* white pepper, to taste
* 1 small garlic clove

## Instructions

For the macadamia tarator sauce, preheat the oven to 180°C. Place the macadamias on a baking tray and roast for 10-12 minutes or until lightly toasted.

Soak the bread in 150 ml cold water for a few minutes or until soft. Place the nuts, soaked bread, oil, vinegar, garlic, salt and pepper in a blender and blend until smooth. Adjust the consistency with a little extra water if necessary and check the seasoning. Refrigerate until ready to serve.

Preheat a chargrill pan over high heat. When hot, add the saltbush and cook until lightly charred.

Meanwhile, cut the calamari hoods down the centre and use a small sharp knife to score the flesh in a cross hatch patten. Cut into 4 long strips each. Cook the calamari for 3-4 minutes or until lightly charred and tender.

To serve, spread some tarator on each plate, top with the calamari, then garnish with the saltbush and finger lime pearls.
