## Ingredients

### Popcorn Chicken

-   4 deboned, skin on chicken thighs
-   1 tablespoon soy sauce
-   1.5 - 2 pieces fermented tofu (optional)
-   ½ teaspoon sugar
-   1 teaspoon black vinegar 
-   1 tablespoon Taiwanese mushroom oyster sauce
-   ½ teaspoon ground white pepper
-   1 teaspoon minced garlic
-   1 tablespoon Taiwanese rice wine
-   ½ teaspoon Chinese five spice powder
-   750ml vegetable oil
-   1 bunch Thai basil leaves, picked
-   250g sweet potato starch
-   ½ teaspoon ground white pepper
-   ½ teaspoon salt
-   ½ teaspoon chilli powder (optional)

## Steps

-   Cut chicken into bite size pieces.
-   Make a marinade by combining soy sauce, fermented tofu if using, sugar, black vinegar, mushroom oyster sauce, ½ teaspoon white pepper, minced garlic, rice wine and five spice powder together. Add the cut chicken and stir to coat
-   In a large wok over medium heat, warm vegetable oil to 160°C. Carefully add in the large handful of Thai basil leaves and as it starts to spit a bit and small bubbles appear around the edges of the leaves, scoop them out with a strainer and set aside.
-   Toss the marinated chicken pieces with sweet potato starch and place into oil to fry for 1-2mins, removing while the chicken pieces are still white.
-   Increase heat to 190°C and once it starts rippling, return chicken pieces, fry for another 1 min, until golden. Return the fried basil leaves to the chicken and fry for another 10-20 seconds then scoop everything out of the fryer. Drain on a tray lined with paper towel.
-   Combine ½ teaspoon of pepper, salt and the chilli powder if using in a large bowl. Toss the chicken through the seasoning and serve.
