A great summer cake, light and full of seasonal fruit. The recipe is a breeze to whip up and also works well with mulberries or raspberries.

## Ingredients
- 125g unsalted butter, soft
- 1 cup white sugar
- 2 whole eggs2 cups plain flour
- 1 tsp bicarbonate soda
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 200ml sour cream
- 1 tbsp lemon juice
- 250g (1½ punnets) blueberries - or raspberries or, better still, mulberries if you can get them
- 1/2 cup chopped walnuts


### Icing
3/4 cup icing sugar
1/2 tsp vanilla extract (optional)
About 2 tbsp hot water

## Method

Preheat oven to 175C. Beat the butter and sugar together until creamy and pale. Then slowly whisk in the eggs, one at a time until well incorporated.

Sift together the flour, bicarb soda and baking powder into a bowl, then fold into the butter mixture, alternating the sour cream and lemon juice until you have a smooth batter.

Pour into a lined lamington tin (30cm x 21cm) and sprinkle over the blueberries and walnuts. They will sit on top for now but as the cake bakes will sink in.

Bake for 50-60 minutes, or until golden on top. To check, insert a skewer in the middle; it should come out clean. Cool in tin.

**For the icing**

Put icing sugar in a small bowl. Gradually pour in the hot water, mixing with a fork, until you have a thick, smooth pourable consistency. Mix in vanilla if using. Drizzle over cooled cake in tin and allow to set before serving.
