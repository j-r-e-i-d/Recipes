# Tiramisu

## Ingredients

*Serves 5*

**Sponge**

- 120g soft butter
- 180g castor sugar
- 3 eggs
- 220g flour
- 120ml milk

**Sabayon**

- 5 eggs
- 80g sugar
- 125ml Marsala
- 700g mascarpone

**Coffee mixture**

- 800ml coffee (long black)
- 60ml Liquore Strega
- 60ml alchermes

**To assemble**

- 200g dark chocolate (grated)
- cocoa powder for dusting

## Method

For the sponge:

1.  Cream the butter and sugar in a bowl mixer with a whisk attachment. Drop in two of the eggs one by one until they both emulsify.
2.  Add the flour, milk and the final egg and fold together without agitating excessively until well combined.
3.  Pour the mix into a lined round tin and bake at 160ºC for 40 minutes.
4.  Let the sponge cool on a cake rack for at least 30 minutes.

For the sabayon:

1.  Combine the eggs, sugar and Marsala in a large steel (or copper) whisking bowl. Place over a pot of simmering water and whisk well until the temperature is just above 64ºC (use a thermometer to check it doesn’t go far over that temperature, as you want the sabayon to hold as much volume as possible). This is the key to the whole recipe.
2.  Let the sabayon cool for a few minutes before folding through the mascarpone. If the mixture is too hot, the mascarpone will split. If it is too cold the sabayon will lose body.
3.  Once the mascarpone is incorporated, place this mix in the fridge until assembly.

Coffee mixture and assembly:

1.  When the sponge is cool and the sabayon has been made, prepare the coffee mix by extracting (or buying) 800 millilitres of coffee in a long black measure. Add the Strega and the alchermes and place into a bowl a little bigger than the base of the sponge.
2.  Cut the top and bottom off the sponge, then cut into three even discs using a bread knife. Place one disc into the coffee mixture and then lift it out using a spider strainer or similar. Let the excess coffee mix drain off before placing the sponge into your serving bowl.
3.  Scatter a third of the grated chocolate evenly over the sponge, then top that with a third of the sabayon mix. Repeat these layers until the sponge, sabayon and chocolate are all used.
4.  Cover and place the assembled tiramisu in the fridge for at least two hours, but preferably overnight so that everything gets to know each other.
5.  Prior to serving, dust the top liberally with cocoa. Ladle with a large spoon directly onto each plate.
