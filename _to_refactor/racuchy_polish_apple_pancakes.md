Also known as: "Placki z Jabłkami". Soft and fluffy apple pancakes, a hit among youngsters. Perfect for breakfast, dessert or a quick snack. So quick & easy to make - no yeast is needed!

## Ingredients

* 3 cups (350-400 g) All-purpose flour
* 2 cups (500 ml) whole milk
* 2 medium eggs
* 3 tsp (15 g) baking soda
* 4 large apples
* 2 tsp (5 g) powdered sugar
* a pinch of salt
* 1 tsp cinnamon (optional)
* 2 tbsp clarified butter (for frying)

 ## Instructions
1. Peel the apples. Grab each apple by the top and the bottom of the core and grate it using large holes. Place in a strainer over a bowl, and let the grated apples sit there for now.
2. Get a large bowl. Sift the flour. Gradually pour in the milk, mixing together with a whisk (fork works well too). 
3. Add 2 eggs, 3 teaspoons of baking soda, 2 teaspoons of powdered sugar, a pinch of salt and optionally - a teaspoon of cinnamon. 
4. Mix everything together well. The batter should be smooth and ideally lump-free.
5. Add grated apples to the batter, blend everything together with a spatula.
6. Grease the frying pan with clarified butter (regular butter tends to burn, you can use canola oil instead). Set it on a medium heat.
7. Using a small ladle (or just a regular tablespoon), pour the batter onto the frying pan and form a small pancake. Make sure the pancake isn't too thick! Repeat until you're out of space on the pan.
8. Fry the pancakes for 2-3 min on each side until golden. 
9. Repeat until you're out of batter. Keep them warm in a low oven as you go (optional).
10. Serve warm or cold. Top with cream, sprinkle with powdered sugar.
