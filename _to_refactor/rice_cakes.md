# Rice Cakes

There is an infinite amount of recipes on the internet, but not many are as synonymous with cycling as the one for rice cakes. It’s always a good idea to seek inspiration among those who enjoy the same lifestyle as you, meaning they love cycling. There are so many cyclists who regularly use and love rice cakes that it can’t be assigned to just one. But one person stands out as the most qualified to make them.


This recipe comes from a book called Vélochef by Team Sky’s head chef Henrik Orre. It’s an iconic cycling snack designed to give riders plenty of easy-to-digest energy. It’s full of complex and simple carbs as you would expect. But it became popular because it’s a solid, crunchy, and tasty food that can replace energy bars. Riders learn to love them when a thought of another gooey gel and the samey bar is repulsive. This recipe yields approximately 20 cakes, give it a try. Enjoy!
