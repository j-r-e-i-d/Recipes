* **55 g** (¼ cup) white sugar
* **1 tsp** dried yeast
* **1 tsp** baking powder
* **¼ tsp** salt
* **60 g** unsalted butter
* **¼ cup** pistachios, chopped

**Cream filling**

* **185 ml** (¾ cups) milk
* **125 ml** (½ cup) thickened cream

* **1½ tbsp** plain flour
* **1½ tbsp** caster sugar

**Walnut filling**

* **150 g** walnuts, finely chopped
* **55 g** (¼ cup) caster sugar

**Syrup**

* **220 g** (2 cups) white sugar

* **2 tsp** rosewater (see Note)

## Instructions
**Proving time** 2 hours

For the pancakes, place the flour, semolina, sugar, yeast, baking powder, salt and 435 ml (1¾ cups) warm water in a large bowl and whisk until smooth. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside for 2 hours at room temperature until mixture is aerated and bubbly.

Meanwhile, for the syrup, combine the sugar and 250 ml (1 cup) water in a saucepan and bring to the boil. Add the lemon juice, reduce the heat and simmer for 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the rosewater. Set aside to cool and refrigerate until ready to use.

For the cream filling, combine all the Ingredients in a saucepan and whisk to combine. Place over medium heat and cook, whisking constantly, for 2–3 minutes until thickened. Transfer to a bowl and refrigerate until chilled.

For the walnut filling place all the Ingredients in a bowl and mix until combined, set aside.

Add 60 ml (¼ cup) water to the pancake batter and mix until incorporated. Heat a non-stick, heavy-based frying pan over medium heat and grease lightly with butter. Pour 2 tablespoons of batter into the pan and cook for 2 minutes until the top is just dry (do not turn). Remove from the pan and allow to cool for 2 minutes. Place 1 teaspoon of either filling in the centre of the pancake and fold in half then press the edges together to seal. Repeat with remaining butter, pancakes and filling.

To serve, arrange the pancakes on a serving platter, drizzle with syrup and top with pistachios.

**Note**

* Semolina and rosewater are available from Middle Eastern food stores and select delicatessens and supermarkets.
