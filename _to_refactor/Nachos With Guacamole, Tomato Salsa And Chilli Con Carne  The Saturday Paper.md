Recently, I watched sport more than I ever have: the Olympics on two consecutive days. It was actually a nice thing to do with the kids, to watch the Australians, and the gymnastics, and the unfortunate Japanese pole vaulter. It was the first time we’ve really eaten in front of the television as a family, and nachos was the order of the day. It was something I hadn’t cooked in 25 years, since my share-house days.

Weirdly, it was the second time nachos had come up in as many weeks. A few days earlier I had been cooking with a bunch of other chefs, and conversation turned to nachos. After service, over a few beers, guards dropped and there was a unanimous consensus that the dish is actually pretty good.

A New Zealand chef was talking about a staple of crumbed and deep-fried lasagna. Deep-fried pizza came up, which happens in Britain and some corners of the Commonwealth. And then we got to nachos.

One of the chefs had been at a country pub that served 20 different parmas. He opted for the nachos parma, with broken corn chips under the cheese and tinned refried beans and fridgey guacamole on top. This won on the scale of scary foods. The chef said it was actually quite good. And we did agree that in the right context, nachos are really fun to make and eat.

There’s not a lot to do to the cooking process when looking to improve what we might think of as nachos – you could add pickled jalapeños and so on – but what really makes this dish are the salsa and the guacamole.

The nachos I made for the kids was served with an American chilli con carne recipe that actually doesn’t have much chilli in it at all but is a foundation of Tex-Mex cooking. This chilli can be served with nachos or even smothered on a hot dog. Look out for that recipe next Olympics.
