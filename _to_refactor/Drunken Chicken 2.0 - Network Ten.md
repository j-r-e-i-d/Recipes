## Steps

-   Preheat oven to 180°C.

-   Combine remaining ingredients (except chicken breasts) in a large saucepan. Bring to the boil. Add chicken breasts then remove from heat. Cover with a lid and allow to poach for at least 20 minutes.
-   When cool to touch, shred chicken breasts, reserving the poaching liquid.
-   For the Drunken Broth, bring poaching liquid to a simmer. Add chillies and ginger and simmer for 20 minutes. Add gula melaka, rice wine vinegar and salt, adding more if required. Strain broth and set aside, keeping warm.
-   For the Bruised Salad, place peanuts onto a tray and roast until brown, about 15 minutes.
-   Using a mortar and pestle, lightly pound the dried shrimp to a coarse paste, leaving some shrimp whole. Add tomatoes and lightly bruise them with the pestle. Transfer to a bowl and add green mangoes, green beans and herbs. Add gula melaka, fish sauce and lime juice to the mortar. Grind lightly until sugar is dissolved. Taste the dressing and adjust if necessary. Add dressing to salad along with roasted peanuts and sliced chillies.
-   To serve, ladel broth into bowls. Add shredded chicken then pile the salad on top. Finish with chicken skin shards.
