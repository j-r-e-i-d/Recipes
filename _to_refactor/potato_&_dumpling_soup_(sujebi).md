I call this the minestrone of Korea. Sujebi is a comforting and wholesome soup, filled with potatoes and hand-torn dumplings, that’s perfect for cold weather.

## Ingredients
[Cabbage kimchi (baechu kimchi)](Cabbage%20kimchi%20(baechu%20kimchi).md) to serve

**Dumpling dough**

300 g (10½ oz/2 cups) plain (all-purpose) flour, plus extra for dusting
1 egg
1 tbsp vegetable oil
½ tsp salt

**Soup**
2 floury potatoes, such as russets or colibans
Anchovy and kelp stock (recipe here)
1 tbsp fish sauce
2 spring onions (scallions), cut into 5-cm (2-in) lengths

## Instructions

To make the dumpling dough, put the flour in a large bowl and make a well in the centre. Add the remaining Ingredients and, using a fork, slowly bring everything together to form a soft dough. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead for at least 5 minutes, until the dough is smooth and elastic. Form the dough into a ball and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate until ready to use.
To make the soup, peel the potatoes and cut into 1 cm (½ in) cubes. Combine the potato and stock in a large saucepan and bring to the boil over medium–high heat. Unwrap the dough and, holding it in one hand, pinch and stretch a small piece of dough from the ball until you have a small 3–4 cm (1¼–1½ in) piece. Tear it off and drop it into the boiling stock. Repeat with the remaining dough.
Cook for 2–3 minutes, stirring occasionally. The dumplings are cooked when they float to the surface. Season with the fish sauce, add the spring onion and mix well. Taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary.
Ladle the soup into individual bowls and serve hot with the cabbage kimchi.
