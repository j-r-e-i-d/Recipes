* Yield: Makes about 2 L
* Active time: 3 minutes
* Total time:15 minutes

## Ingredients

* 2L water
* 1 ounce (30g) dried kombu (see note)
* 1 ounce (30g) packed dried bonito flakes (katsuobushi, see note)

## Directions
Combine water and kombu in a medium saucepan. Bring to a bare simmer over medium heat. Remove from heat and add bonito flakes. Let stand for 5 minutes. Strain through a fine mesh strainer and discard kombu and bonito, or reserve to make a second, weaker batch of dashi. Dashi can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.

### Notes
Kombu and shaved katsuobushi is widely available at Japanese grocers or in the Asian section of most large supermarkets.
