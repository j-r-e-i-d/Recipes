If you’re looking to mix sweet and sour, this Russian recipe is perfect for breakfast (or dessert)

In Russia, these light and fluffy cheese pancakes are traditionally made from quark, a fresh cow’s milk cheese, but cottage cheese is a close substitute and much more readily available in Australia. They are eaten with sour cream and jam or apple sauce.

## Ingredients

* **500 g** (2½ cups) cottage cheese
* **2** eggs, lightly beaten
* **80 g** caster sugar
* **200 g** (1⅓ cups) plain flour, sifted
* **1 tsp** bicarbonate of soda
* **1 tsp** white vinegar
* vegetable oil, to brush
* sour cream, to serve

**Caramelised apples**

* **80 g** unsalted butter, chopped
* **150 g** brown sugar
* **2** Granny Smith apples, thinly sliced
* **125 ml** (½ cup) thickened cream

## Instructions
**Resting time** 30 minutes

Combine cottage cheese, eggs, sugar, flour, bicarbonate of soda and vinegar in a bowl, mixing until smooth. Set aside to rest for 30 minutes.

To make caramelised apples, melt butter in a deep frying pan over medium heat. Add sugar and stir to dissolve. Add apples and cook, turning once, for 6 minutes or until deep golden. Remove from heat and stir in cream. Allow to cool slightly.

Brush a frying pan with oil and place over medium-low heat. Working in batches, pour 60 ml (¼ cup) batter into pan for each syrniki. Cook for 3 minutes on each side or until golden and cooked through. Serve warm with caramelised apples and sour cream.
