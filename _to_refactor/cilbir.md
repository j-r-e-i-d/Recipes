This traditional Turkish breakfast is delicious even without the milk crumbs, but I’ve loved them since coming across them at the brilliant [Tulum in Melbourne](http://tulumrestaurant.com.au/). Bread, however, is a must, for mopping up. Eat this just warm, not piping hot.

**Serves four**

60g unsalted butter

1 tsp aleppo chilli flakes (or ½ tsp if using another chilli flake)

1 tbsp white-wine vinegar

8 large eggs

320g Greek-style yoghurt

3 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed

2 tsp dill, roughly chopped

Soft Turkish bread (or other good-quality white bread), to serve

Flaky sea salt

**For the milk crumbs**

50g unsalted butter

25g dried milk powder

⅛ tsp flaky sea salt

To make the milk crumbs, combine 50g butter, the milk powder and an eighth of a teaspoon of flaky salt in a small saucepan. Cook on a low heat for about 10 minutes, stirring constantly so it doesn’t catch, until golden, then spread out on a baking tray lined with kitchen paper and leave to cool. It will set and harden.

Wipe clean the saucepan, then melt 60g butter on a medium heat for a minute or two, until it starts to foam and turn golden-brown. Whisk in the chilli, then take off the heat.

Fill a large bowl with warm water from the tap. Three-quarters fill a large frying pan with water, add the vinegar, bring up to a boil, then turn down the heat to medium-low, so only a few bubbles disturb the surface of the water.

Break the eggs one at a time into a small bowl or ramekin, then carefully tip into the pan. Poach for three minutes, then use a slotted spoon to transfer to the bowl of warm water.

Put the yoghurt, garlic and a quarter-teaspoon of salt in a second small saucepan. On the lowest heat possible, heat the mix through for five minutes, until warm (take care: if it gets too hot, it will split).

To serve, divide the warm yoghurt between four bowls and top each portion with two poached eggs. Spoon over the chilli butter and dill, sprinkle milk crumbs on top and serve with bread for mopping.
