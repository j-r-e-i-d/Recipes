This dish is impossibly easy to throw together, and lamb shoulder is a delightfully forgiving cut on the grill – zero experience required.

*Serves 6-8*

**Ingredients**

* 1.25kg boneless lamb shoulder
* 12 anchovy ﬁllets, ﬁnely chopped
* 60ml (¼ cup) olive oil, plus extra for cooking
* salt and freshly ground black pepper
* 1kg very ripe tomatoes, sliced 2cm thick
* 4 green garlic stalks (garlic shoots), thinly sliced, or 2 garlic cloves, ﬁnely grated
* 2 tbsp lemon juice, white wine vinegar or red wine vinegar
* ﬂaky sea salt
* lemony aioli, full-fat Greek-style yoghurt or labne, to serve (optional)
* salsa verde, to serve (optional)
* ﬂatbreads, to serve (optional)

**Method**

**1.** Using a knife, separate the lamb shoulder where it naturally wants to separate, into three or four smaller pieces (almost like a few lamb steaks), to ensure even cooking on the grill.

**2.** Mix the anchovies and olive oil. Season the lamb with salt and pepper and smear the anchovy mixture over. Leave for at least 30 minutes, uncovered and refrigerated.

**3.** Heat a barbecue grill or chargrill pan to medium-high. (Alternatively, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large cast-iron frypan over medium-high heat.)

**4.** Grill the meat on the hottest part of the grill until deeply and evenly charred, 5-8 minutes, depending on the thickness of each piece, flipping frequently to avoid burning. (Or sear in the frypan until golden brown on all sides, 3-5 minutes each side.) Transfer the lamb to a cutting board to rest for 10 minutes.

**5.** Meanwhile, place the tomatoes on a large serving platter and season with salt and pepper. Scatter with the garlic, sprinkle with the lemon juice and set aside.

**6.** Thinly slice the meat and place immediately atop the tomatoes, letting the juices mingle. Sprinkle with flaky salt.
