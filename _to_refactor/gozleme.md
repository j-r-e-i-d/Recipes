## Ingredients

*Makes 6*

### For the dough

* 2¼ cups plain flour
* ½ tsp salt
* ½ cup plain Greek yoghurt

### For a lamb filling

* 1 tbsp olive oil
* 1 small onion, finely diced
* 2 cloves garlic, crushed
* 250g lamb mince
* 1 tbsp tomato paste
* 1 tsp ground coriander
* 1 tsp smoked paprika
* 2 tsp ground cumin
* pinch Aleppo pepper
* ½ tsp salt
* 100g baby spinach
* ½ cup chopped mint
* ½ cup chopped parsley
* 1 medium tomato, diced

### For a spinach filling

* 1 tbsp olive oil
* 2 garlic cloves, crushed
* 300g baby spinach
* 2 eggs
* 1 tsp black pepper
* 300g crumbly fetta
* 2 cups shredded mozzarella or similar
* olive oil for frying
* lemon wedges for serving

## Method

1. Combine the flour and salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the centre and stir in the yoghurt and half a cup of water. Mix until everything is well combined. If the dough is too dry, adjust by adding more water, a tablespoon at a time.
2. Flour your work surface and knead the dough for about three minutes, or until smooth and elastic. Cover with plastic wrap or a clean tea towel and set aside.
3. Lamb filling: In a large, heavy-based frying pan, heat the olive oil and add the chopped onion and garlic. Gently cook until the onion is soft and translucent.
4. Turn up the heat, add the mince to the onions and garlic and break it up with a wooden spoon. Cook for four to five minutes, until browned. Stir in the tomato paste and spices and salt. Add the spinach, stir and cook for another two minutes. Let the mixture cool slightly.
5. Spinach filling: Heat a large pan with the oil, gently cook the garlic, add the spinach just to wilt it. Cool and mix with all other Ingredients in a bowl.
6. Divide the dough into six. Roll each into a rectangle as thinly as you can.
7. Spoon about three tablespoons of the lamb mixture in the middle of the rectangle and spread out. Add some fresh mint, fresh parsley and chopped tomato. Or use the spinach mix in the same way. Fold over the edges of the dough to seal. Repeat with the remaining dough pieces.
8. Place a large heavy-based pan over medium heat and add a splash of oil. Depending on your pan size, add two or three of the gozleme and cook on each side for about three to four minutes or until golden brown and crisp. Keep warm in a 160ºC oven while cooking the rest.
9. Cut each gozleme in half and serve with lemon wedges.
