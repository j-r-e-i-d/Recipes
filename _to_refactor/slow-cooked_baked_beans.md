## Ingredients

* **400 g** (14 oz) dried haricot, cannellini or borlotti (cranberry) beans
* **2 tbsp** salt
* **60 ml** (2 fl oz/¼ cup) extra virgin olive oil
* **2** red onions, finely chopped
* **2** garlic cloves, finely chopped
* **1** carrot, chopped
* **2** celery stalks, diced
* **1** bay leaf
* **2 tsp** sweet paprika
* **400 g** (14 oz) tinned crushed tomatoes
* **190 ml** (6½ fl oz/¾ cup) tomato passata
* **1½ tsp** sea salt flakes
* **2 tbsp** dark muscovado sugar
* **60 ml** (2 fl oz/¼ cup) cider vinegar

## Instructions
**Soaking time:** overnight

**This recipe needs to be started one day in advance.**

1. Put the beans in a large bowl and sprinkle with the salt. Cover with plenty of cold water and leave to soak for 8 hours, or overnight.

2. The next day, preheat the oven to 140°C/275°F (fan-forced).

3. Drain the beans, place in a saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Drain, rinse with cold water and set aside.

4. Heat the olive oil in a large flameproof casserole dish over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, carrot and celery and cook, stirring, for 10 minutes. Add the drained beans, bay leaf and paprika, mixing well.

5. Stir in the tomatoes, passata, salt flakes, sugar and vinegar. Add 2 litres (68 fl oz/8 cups) water, or enough to generously cover the beans to a depth of 10 cm (4 inches).

6. Bring the mixture to a gentle boil, then cover the pan with a sheet of baking paper. Put the lid on and carefully transfer to the oven. Bake for 2 hours.

7. Check the beans and give them a stir. The sauce should be a little runny, but starting to thicken; if it is looking dry, add a little water.

8. Return to the oven and bake for a further 1 hour, or until the beans are tender, in a rich, thick, glossy sauce.

9. Serve for breakfast, lunch or dinner, alongside eggs on sourdough toast, or with salad.
