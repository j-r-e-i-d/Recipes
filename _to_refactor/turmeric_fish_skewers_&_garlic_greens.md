My brother is a dietitian and I remember how he would come home every night while he was training and sing the praises of "fish and broccoli" as a nutritious meal. It's stuck with me all these years. Instead of navigating kilojoule counts, diets and an ever-changing sea of labels, there are a few core principles that always hold true for healthy eating: cook using fresh Ingredients instead of buying processed foods; eat a wide variety of foods, especially vegetables; eat everything in moderation.

1/2 cup Greek yoghurt

1/2 tsp ground turmeric

1 tsp ground coriander

1/4 tsp chilli powder, or to taste

1/2 tsp salt

1/4 tsp ground black pepper

600g ling fillets, cut into 5cm cubes

2 tbsp olive oil

4 cloves garlic, sliced

2 thin spring onions, sliced

1 bunch broccolini, cut into 5cm lengths

1/2 bunch spinach, cut into 5cm lengths

1 small bunch kale, torn into bite-sized pieces

lemon wedges, to serve

1. Heat an overhead grill to very high, or a barbecue until it's very hot.

2. Combine the yoghurt, turmeric, coriander, chilli powder, salt and pepper and coat the ling fillets in the mixture. Set aside for 10 minutes then thread the fish onto soaked skewers and cook, turning occasionally, until the fish is cooked through, about five minutes.

3. Heat a large frying pan over a high heat, add the olive oil, garlic and spring onions, and fry until fragrant.

4. Add the broccolini and fry for about three minutes, then add the spinach and kale, season with lots of salt and pepper and fry for a further two minutes, stirring well.

5. Arrange the greens on a platter and top with the fish skewers. Serve with lemon wedges.
