I have taken great liberties with it and in the process turned it into a warm, squidgy pudding, to be eaten with a tangy splodge of creme fraiche and a tumble of sharp raspberries. Insistently sweet, it does need the counterbalance.
You can, of course, eat them as blondies, in traditional fashion, in which case I’d give them another 5 minutes in the oven, loosely covered with foil. Let them get completely cold, then put in the fridge to chill completely before cutting them into squares.

## Ingredients
Makes: 9 large squares

* 200 grams soft unsalted butter (cut into cubes or spooned into blobs, plus more for greasing)
* 75 grams white cooking chocolate (chopped into smallish pieces)
* 175 grams soft light brown sugar
* 2 teaspoons ground ginger
* 3 large eggs (at room temperature) - lightly whisked
* 100 grams walnuts (roughly chopped so that you have both small pieces and dusty rubble)
* 150 grams ground almonds
**To Serve**
* creme fraiche
* raspberries

## Method
You will need 1 x approx. 23cm / 9-inch square baking dish.
1 Preheat the oven to 170°C/150°C Fan/325°F and very lightly grease your pudding dish.
2 Melt the butter and chocolate in a heavy-based saucepan very, very gently. Keep the heat really low and be patient. Don’t stir, just lift the pan up and give it a swirl every now and then.
3 Once it is a sludgy paste in buttery liquid – how charmingly attractive that sounds – remove from the heat before adding the sugar and ginger, and stir gently to combine. It should amalgamate into a glossy-looking fudge. Allow to cool off the hob for 10 minutes. Don’t worry if the butter and chocolate separate as it stands: all will come good when you add the eggs.
4 Stir in the eggs and keep stirring until they’re completely incorporated. Add the chopped walnuts and ground almonds and, again, stir gently to combine.
5 Pour into your prepared dish or tin and bake in the oven for 35–40 minutes, or until golden brown on top, crisp at the edges and beginning to come away from the sides of the dish or tin. It should feel a little squidgy under its just-firm top; a cake tester will not come out completely clean, but with a few damp crumbs clinging to it.
6 Leave to cool for 30–40 minutes before cutting into it, and serve with crème fraîche and raspberries.

### Additional Information
Make Ahead / Store:
The batter can be mixed up to 1 hour before baking and left in a cool (but not cold) place. Refrigerate leftovers, tightly covered with cling film, for up to 1 week. Eat cold, cut into slabs or squares.
