# Dacquoise Date and Nut Meringue Cake

Variation on a French meringue dessert - Dacquoise cake. In the original, they are meringue tops with whipped cream with nuts or almonds. Here a version referring to the famous version of the Dacquoise cake from the Sowa confectionery, slightly modified by me.

My version is nut meringue tops with two layers of mascarpone cream, cream and butterscotch, lots of nuts and dates, additionally covered with butterscotch glaze and sprinkled with cocoa.

This version is delicious! Simply to fall in love - it melts in your mouth and pampers you with a nut-date-butterscotch flavor with elements of crunchy meringue! But be warned, this is definitely a sweet-loving dessert. The cake is very sweet - definitely for fans of meringue and butterscotch.

## Ingredients

**Meringue**

-   6 L egg proteins for a total of 240 g of protein
-   300 g of fine sugar
-   1 teaspoon of lemon juice
-   1 tablespoon of potato starch
-   40 g walnuts and pecans (half and half, but you can

**Cream**

-   200 g of mascarpone cheese
-   200 g of cream 36%
-   170 g of butterscotch
-   1 tablespoon of powdered sugar
-   1 teaspoon of coffee liqueur
-   80 g walnuts and pecans (half and half, but you can freely choose)
-   80 g of dates

**Decoration**

-   over a dozen halves of walnuts and pecans
-   a few dates
-   cocoa powder for dusting

**Butterscotch**

-   1 heaped tablespoon of butterscotch
-   1 tablespoon of cream, 30% or 36%

## Execution

Draw two circles with a diameter of 20 cm on baking paper. Leave a distance of a few cm between the circles. Put the paper on the oven grate. If we do not have a grate, it may be a baking tray.

Finely chop the nuts. You can also use a food processor, but for a short time - we want finely chopped nuts, not ground to dust

Beat the egg whites stiffly, but only as much as needed - do not prolong the whisking. As soon as the proteins are churned, start adding sugar. This should be done gradually - about 1 large spoonful, whisking constantly. 

When all the sugar is added, add the starch and lemon juice at low speed. Finally, gently mix the chopped nuts

Put the foam on baking paper, dividing it between both circles. Do not go beyond the drawn circles. Use a spoon to even out the foam, making a slight depression in the center and sweeping the sides up

Preheat the oven to 160ºC, put the meringues in and immediately reduce the temperature to 130ºC. Bake for 1 hour. If the meringues are too brown, reduce the temperature to 120 ° C, because the ready meringue should be white to slightly creamy color

Then turn off the oven and open the door to allow the meringues to cool down. It is best to prepare and bake the meringues in the evening and leave them in the oven overnight


Chop the nuts and dates intended for the cream not very finely

Whip the cream stiff at the end adding powdered sugar. Then add the mascarpone, butterscotch and liqueur and gently and briefly mix everything to a homogeneous cream. 

Finally, gently mix in the chopped nuts and dates.

Place the first meringue on a plate and spread 2/3 of the cream on it, then cover with the second meringue, spread the remaining 1/3 of the cream (more in the center, leaving a little free on the sides).

In a pot, heat the butterscotch with cream while stirring - only until combined and obtaining a liquid consistency that will allow the dessert to be poured.

Arrange the walnut halves and pecans decoratively on the cream. Then pour the kajmak glaze over it, and then sprinkle with a small amount of cocoa

Keep dessert in the refrigerator
