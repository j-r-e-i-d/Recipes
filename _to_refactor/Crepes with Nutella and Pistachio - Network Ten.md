## Ingredients

### Crepes

-   40g unsalted butter
-   3 eggs
-   500ml milk
-   Pinch of salt
-   250g plain flour

### Pistachio Cream

-   200g thickened cream
-   55g glucose
-   200g white chocolate
-   200g pistachio paste
-   60g unsalted butter, cubed

-   220g Nutella
-   80g hazelnuts, roasted and roughly chopped
-   80g pistachio kernels, roasted and roughly chopped
-   50g icing sugar

## Steps

-   For the Crepes, melt the butter in a microwave and let it slightly cool down.
-   Whisk the eggs then add the milk and mix until incorporated. Add salt and then the melted butter. Mix until combined.
-   Sift the flour and slowly add to the wet mixture, stirring to combine until fully incorporated.
-   Pass crepe batter through a fine sieve into a bowl and let rest for 10 minutes in the fridge.
-   To cook the crepes, place a lightly oiled crepe pan on medium to high heat. Using a ladle, pour approximately 75ml of batter into the warmed crepe pan moving the pan so the batter spreads into a thin layer and evenly coats the base. Cook for approximately 1 minute then flip the crepe with an offset spatula and cook for another minute.
-   Repeat until all batter is used.
-   For the Pistachio Cream, in a saucepan, combine cream and glucose over medium heat and bring to the boil.
-   Take saucepan off the heat, add white chocolate and the pistachio paste. Mix well to combine.
-   Place saucepan back on low heat and whisk constantly to ensure all ingredients are incorporated and smooth.
-   Take saucepan off the heat and add the butter one cube at a time whisking to incorporate.
-   Allow to cool slightly.
-   To assemble, working with 1 crepe at a time, lay a crepe on the bench and spoon 1 tablespoon of Nutella on top and spread slightly then sprinkle with a generous pinch of chopped hazelnuts. Fold crepe in half and spoon 1 tablespoon of pistachio cream on top and spread slightly then sprinkle with a generous pinch of chopped pistachios. Fold in half again and place on a serving plate
-   Repeat until all crepes are filled.
-   To garnish, drizzle the top of the crepes with some warmed Nutella and pistachio cream, a dusting of icing sugar and remaining chopped hazelnuts and pistachio nuts.
