Ricotta pancakes with sour cherries, clotted cream and honey.

Prep **10-15 min**

Cook **2 min per pancake**

Makes **18**

**100g dried and sweetened sour cherries** (or cranberries), whole or roughly chopped

**6 tbsp water**

**2 tbsp caster sugar**

**A few knobs of butter**

**1 large egg**

**150g self-raising flour**

**250ml milk**

**1 generous pinch salt flakes**, crushed

**250g ricotta**

**Clear honey and clotted cream**, to serve

Heat a small saucepan over a medium heat. Put the sour cherries into the pan with the water, sugar and a knob of butter. Gently heat the mixture as the cherries hydrate. After five to six minutes, take the pan off the heat and leave to cool.

Heat a large frying pan over a medium-high heat. In a bowl, combine the egg, flour, milk and crushed salt, and whisk well without over-beating. Donâ€™t worry if the batter is not perfectly smooth. Stir in the ricotta.

Put a couple of knobs of butter into the hot pan and pour in a generous tablespoon of the batter to make one pancake. Cook as many pancakes as you can simultaneously without overcrowding the pan. After cooking for roughly a minute, flip over the pancakes and cook for a minute on the other side, or until golden brown. Repeat until all the batter has been used.

Serve the pancakes with a good drizzle of clear honey, a few dollops of clotted cream and the cherries.
