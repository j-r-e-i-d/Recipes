There is not a type of French toast I don't love, but this version - a kind of eggy, squidgy toast and marmalade - is the perfect mixture between morning-sharp and weekend treatiness

## **Ingredients**
Serves: 2

* 2 large eggs
* grated zest of 1 orange
* 60 ml full fat milk
* Â¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 2 large, thick slices white bread
* juice of 1 orange
* 75 grams fine-cut marmalade such as Tiptree
* 50 grams caster sugar
* 1 tablespoon butter

## Method
Whisk the eggs, orange zest, milk and ground cinnamon in a wide shallow dish.Soak the bread slices in this mixture for 2 minutes a side.While the eggy bread is soaking, bring the orange juice, marmalade and sugar to the boil in a saucepan, then turn down the heat to a fast simmer for 3-4 minutes. If you need to, let this syrup stand while you cook the bread.Heat the butter in a heavy-based frying pan and cook the eggy bread for about 2 minutes a side over a medium heat until golden.Serve the French toast with some of the amber syrup poured over each slice, and a jug of extra syrup on the side.
