Aka breakfast of champignons. This works in the morning, for brunch or as a first course later in the day. For an extra-rich twist, use duck eggs instead of hens’. Serves four.

**400g portobello mushrooms, cut into 2-3cm wedges**

**75ml olive oil**

**2 small garlic cloves, peeled and crushed**

**½ tsp ground cinnamon**

**Flaked sea salt and black pepper**

**5g basil leaves, roughly shredded** 

**⅛ tsp chilli flakes**

**4 2cm-thick slices brioche**

**4 large eggs**

**100g soured cream**

Heat the oven to 220C. In a bowl, mix the mushrooms, three tablespoons of oil, half the garlic, half the cinnamon, half a teaspoon salt and a good grind of pepper. Spread out on a large oven tray lined with baking paper, then roast for 15 minutes, stirring halfway, until soft and starting to brown. Remove from the oven, toss in the basil and keep warm.

While the mushrooms are roasting, mix the remaining oil, garlic and cinnamon with the chilli flakes and a quarter teaspoon of salt. Brush the flavoured oil over one side of each brioche slice, then lay the bread oiled side up on an oven tray lined with baking paper. Roast for six to seven minutes, until golden brown and crisp, then remove and keep warm.

Bring a medium saucepan of water to a boil, then turn down the heat to medium-high and break in the eggs one at a time. Poach for 90 seconds for a runny yolk, and a little longer for a firmer set.

While the eggs are poaching, put a warm brioche slice on each of four plates and top with mushrooms. Use a slotted spoon to lift the eggs from the water, drain on kitchen paper, then lay on top of the mushrooms. Sprinkle each egg with a pinch of salt and grind of pepper, and serve warm with a dollop of soured cream.
