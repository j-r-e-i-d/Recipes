This is a new, quick take on an East European classic blini (pancake). In the traditional version, fresh yeast is used, but that recipe does take quite a while. If you fancy trying the traditional buckwheat pancake, you can find the recipe here – it’s delicious, but this no fuss version is also very tasty and so much quicker. You can easily make these gluten-free by making them 100% buckwheat and adding 1 teaspoon of (gluten free) baking powder.

Ingredients – serves 4

325ml milk

100g self raising flour

100g buckwheat flour

1 egg, separated

150g salted butter, melted

pinch of salt

rapeseed/canola oil for frying

smoked salmon, soured cream and dill to serve

* Sift both the flours into a large bowl and add the pinch of salt
* Whisk the egg white to soft peaks.
* Add the egg yolk, the melted butter and the milk into the large bowl and mix well until there are no lumps.
* Fold the egg whites into the batter.
* Heat the rapeseed oil on a frying pan and fry the batter in batches for about 2-3 minutes on each side. Sometimes, I even like to do one large blini per person, as you see on the photo up there.
* Serve the blini with smoked salmon, soured cream and dill on top.
