A fragrant and spicy tomato-cream bath gives humble chickpeas a taste of the good life in this weeknight dinner recipe.

## Ingredients

* 2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil
* 2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
* 1 sprig rosemary (optional)
* 1 can chickpeas, rinsed
* 1 Tbsp. tomato paste
* 1 tsp. sweet smoked paprika
* 1 cup heavy cream
* Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper
* 2 large eggs
* 4 thin slices of prosciutto
* Flaky sea salt (optional)
* Flatbread (for serving)

## Recipe Preparation

* Heat oil in a medium skillet over medium. Cook garlic and rosemary (if using), tossing, until garlic is golden brown and rosemary crisps up slightly but isn’t browned, about 30 seconds for rosemary and 2 minutes for garlic. Transfer rosemary to a plate.
* Add chickpeas, tomato paste, and paprika to skillet and cook, stirring often, until coated, about 1 minute. Mix in cream, season with kosher salt and lots of pepper, and bring to a simmer.
* Crack eggs into chickpea mixture and season them with kosher salt. Cover (a baking sheet works great if you don’t have a matching lid) and cook until white parts of eggs are set but yolks are still runny, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and drape prosciutto around eggs. Crumble rosemary on top and sprinkle with sea salt, if desired, and more pepper. Serve with flatbread.
