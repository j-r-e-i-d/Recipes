You will need to start these the day before you intend to bake them.

Makes about 24

**For the cookies**
225g dark chocolate, coarsely chopped
155g flour
50g unsweetened cocoa powder
2 tsp baking powder
115g unsalted butter, at room temperature
225g sugar, plus more to roll the logs in
2 large eggs
½ tsp fine salt
1 tsp vanilla extract
75ml whole milk
Granulated sugar, for rolling
Maldon salt, for finishing

**For the salted caramel filling**
50g granulated sugar
30ml water
60ml double cream
1 tsp vanilla extract
170g unsalted butter, at room temperature
½ tsp fine salt
115g caster sugar

1 First make the cookie dough. Fill a saucepan with about 3cm of water and bring to a simmer over a medium heat. Put the chocolate in a large, dry stainless steel or ceramic bowl and set it so that it hovers over the simmering water. The bottom of the bowl should not touch the liquid. Stirring occasionally, melt the chocolate until it’s smooth. Remove and set aside.

2 In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa and baking powder.

3 Use a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment to beat the butter on medium-high speed until creamy: about 2 minutes. Add the sugar slowly in a thin stream. Continue mixing until it is completely smooth and soft, stopping to scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula.

4 Add the eggs one at a time, then the salt, vanilla, melted chocolate and milk, mixing well after each addition. Reduce the speed to low and add the flour mixture. Mix until barely incorporated. The dough will be quite thick and stiff.

5 Divide the dough into 4. Put each portion on a large piece of clingfilm. Using the wrapping to help, roll and shape each piece into a log 3cm in diameter. Twist the ends to seal. Chill overnight.

6 Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4 and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Put another sheet of parchment paper on your work surface. Pour a line of sugar as long as the dough logs on to the parchment. Unwrap a chilled log of dough and roll it in the sugar to coat evenly. Using a thin, sharp knife, slice the dough into 6-8mm slices. Lay the slices on the baking sheet, leaving about 3cm between each. Sprinkle each slice with a few flakes of Maldon salt. Repeat with the remaining dough.

7 Bake for 10-12 minutes, until the tops of the cookies look set but still feel soft to the touch. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

8 While the cookies bake and cool, make the caramel filling. Stir together the sugar and water in a small saucepan and bring to a boil over a medium-high heat. Continue cooking, without stirring, until the mixture turns dark amber in colour.

9 Remove from the heat and slowly add the cream and vanilla, stirring with a whisk until completely smooth. Set aside until cool to the touch – about 25 minutes.

10 Combine the butter and salt in the bowl of the stand mixer, still fitted with the paddle attachment, and beat on a medium-high speed until light in colour and fluffy – about 3 minutes. Reduce the speed to low, add the caster sugar, and mix until completely incorporated. Turn the mixer off and scrape down the sides of the bowl, then add the prepared caramel. Beat the mixture on medium-high speed until airy and thoroughly mixed – about 2 minutes. Taste and add more salt if desired. Cover and refrigerate until stiff – about 45 minutes – before using.

11 To assemble the cookies, spread about 2 teaspoons of filling on to the bottom of a cooled cookie, then set a second cookie on top, right side up. Press gently to sandwich.
