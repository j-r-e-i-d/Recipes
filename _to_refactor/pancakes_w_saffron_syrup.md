Pancakes with sugar and lemon will never quite cut it again after you’ve tried these fluffy fennel-infused yoghurt pancakes, soaked in a fragrant saffron-and-cardamom syrup, and topped with pistachios. Popular in the Bengali regions of Bangladesh and India, malpua vary from place to place, but are generally served as a dessert or snack during festivals.

## Ingredients

* **150 g** (1 cup) plain flour
* **110 g** (½ cup) caster sugar
* **2 tsp** fennel seeds, coarsely crushed
* **280 g** (1 cup) Greek-style yoghurt
* **160 g** (⅔ cup) ghee
* pistachios, to serve

**Saffron syrup**

* **330 g** (1½ cups) caster sugar
* large pinch saffron threads
* **½ tsp** ground cardamom
* **1 tbsp** rosewater (see Note)

## Instructions
**Resting time** 4 hours

Combine flour, sugar and fennel in a bowl. In a separate bowl, combine yoghurt and 125 ml (½ cup) water and whisk until smooth. Add to flour mixture and whisk until smooth. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside at room temperature for 4 hours or until mixture bubbles slightly.

Meanwhile, to make syrup, place sugar, saffron and 375 ml (1½ cups) water in a small saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a simmer, stirring to dissolve sugar. Cook for 8 minutes or until thickened and reduced. Cool slightly, then add cardamom and rosewater. Set aside.

Preheat oven to 120°C. Heat enough ghee in a heavy-based frying pan to generously coat surface over medium-high heat. Working in batches, drop 2 tablespoonfuls of batter per pancake onto pan and spread gently to form 9 cm rounds. Cook for 3 minutes or until deep golden on the base, then turn and cook for a further 2 minutes or until cooked through. Transfer to a plate and place in oven to keep warm. Repeat with remaining batter, coating pan with extra ghee before frying.

Serve pancakes topped with warm saffron syrup and pistachios.

**Note**

* Rosewater is from Middle Eastern food shops and select supermarkets.
