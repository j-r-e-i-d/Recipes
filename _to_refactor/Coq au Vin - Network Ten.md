### Mashed Potato

-   300g Sebago or Dutch Cream potatoes, peeled, 5cm cubes
-   100g good quality unsalted butter, cubed
-   2 tbsp milk
-   salt and white pepper, to taste

## Steps

-   Place a chef’s pan over medium-high heat. Add 1 tbsp olive oil, chicken wings or necks, carrot, onion and garlic and cook until golden brown. Add ¼ cup brandy to deglaze the pan then add bay leaf and thyme. Add chicken stock and 375ml wine. Allow to boil and reduce while you prepare the remainder of the dish.
-   Combine the flour, salt and pepper in a bowl. Coat the Marylands thoroughly in the flour. Place 2 tbsp olive oil into a large deep non-stick fry pan over medium-high heat. When hot, add the Marylands and brown on all sides. Transfer the chicken to a plate.
-   Reduce the heat to low-medium. Add the speck and cook for 1 minute, until starting to turn golden. Add the mushrooms and sauté for 3-4 minutes, then add pearl onions and cook until softened and fragrant. Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring, for a further minute. Add remaining brandy and red wine and bring to the boil. Return Marylands and remaining bay leaf to the pan.
-   Simmer, turning the chicken occasionally, until cooked through and the sauce is starting to thicken, about 20 minutes.
-   Meanwhile, strain the contents of the chefs pan through a fine sieve into a saucepan and reduce until thick, glossy and flavourful. Add to the pan with the Marylands and stir through. Balance the sauce with vinegar, sugar, salt and pepper, to taste. Finish by stirring through the butter. Remove from the heat and cover to keep hot.
-   For the Mashed Potato, place potato and salt into medium saucepan. Cover generously with cold water and bring to the boil. Boil until tender, about 10-15 minutes, then drain in a colander. Dry the saucepan and add the butter.
-   Pass the potatoes through a ricer into the saucepan. Using a silicone spatula, fold the milk in, a little at a time, until the potatoes are the required consistency and butter has been incorporated. Season with salt and white pepper, to taste.
-   Serve alongside Coq au Vin.
