Cook 2-3 min per pancake

*Makes 18-24*

## Ingredients

150g oat flour

90g rolled oats

240g plain white or wholemeal flour

3 tsp baking powder

¾ tsp bicarbonate of soda

¾ tsp salt

3 tbsp granulated sugar

3 tbsp ground flaxseed

600ml non-dairy milk

3 tsp apple cider vinegar or lemon juice

6 tbsp olive oil or rapeseed oil, plus extra for frying

Maple syrup. sliced fruit and chopped nuts, to serve

Combine all the dry Ingredients in a medium bowl. Add the wet Ingredients and stir with a fork or small whisk until just combined.

Heat a large, nonstick frying pan and add just enough oil to coat the base of the pan. Once the oil is hot, turn down the heat to medium-low and pour a few tablespoons of batter into the pan to form a pancake, about 8cm in diameter. Repeat this so you have three or four in the pan. Cook the pancakes until the edges change colour and the underside is golden, then flip and cook on the other side until golden. Transfer to a plate and repeat with the remaining batter.

Serve hot with maple syrup, chopped nuts and your choice of fruit (we suggest mango, banana and passionfruit).
