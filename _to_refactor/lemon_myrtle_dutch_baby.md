I cooked this in *[Outback Gourmet](https://www.sbs.com.au/food/program/outback-gourmet)*, when I joined a camp oven dinner at Earth Sanctuary, an award winning centre for astronomy and eco tours in central Australia, but it's also easy to make in your oven at home. A Dutch baby is like a cross between a pancake, a Yorkshire pudding and a popover, and it's said that the name originated at a cafe in America in the early 1900s.

## Ingredients

* **3** eggs
* **¼ cup** caster sugar
* **1 tsp** vanilla extract
* **1 tsp** ground lemon myrtle
* **1 tsp** lemon zest
* **⅔ cup** milk
* **1 cup** plain flour
* Pinch of salt
* **80 g** butter
* **2-3 tbsp** vegetable oil
* **100 ml** whipping cream, whisked to soft peaks
* Strawberries or other seasonal fruit, to serve
* **2 tbsp** icing sugar, to serve

## Instructions

1. If cooking in an oven, preheat oven to 180°C.

2. Whisk the eggs, sugar and vanilla until well combined then add the lemon myrtle, lemon zest and milk. Little by little add the flour and a pinch of salt and whisk until just combined.

3. Heat the butter and oil in a large ovenproof pot with a lid over a medium heat. Once the butter melts and becomes bubbly, add the batter and cover with the lid. Place coals over the top and cook for 20-25 minutes, or if using a conventional oven bake until puffed and golden.

4. Combine the berries with the icing sugar. Serve the Dutch baby with fruit and with a generous dollop of cream.

### Cook's notes
Oven temperatures are for conventional; if using fan-forced (convection), reduce the temperature by 20˚C. | We use Australian tablespoons and cups: 1 teaspoon equals 5 ml; 1 tablespoon equals 20 ml; 1 cup equals 250 ml. | All herbs are fresh (unless specified) and cups are lightly packed. | All vegetables are medium size and peeled, unless specified. | All eggs are 55-60 g, unless specified.
