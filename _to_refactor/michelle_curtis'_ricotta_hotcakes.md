Far from being a chore, the first meal of the day should be something to savour and enjoy. [Breakfast](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/breakfast) is fast disappearing as something to be enjoyed at home, so if you’re one of those people who eat in the car on the way to work, try getting up a few minutes earlier. It doesn’t take long to pour some muesli into a bowl or make a few slices of toast, and it will give you enough energy to at least get through to mid-morning.

These ricotta hotcakes make a perfect brunch dish. They can be served with a range of different fruit, from banana and maple syrup to oven-roasted apricots or poached berries.

*serves 4–6*

115g (½ cup) caster (superfine) sugar, plus 2 tbsp extra

300g raspberries

2 eggs

250g (1 cup) ricotta

60ml (¼ cup) milk

125g (½ cup) natural yoghurt

150g (1 cup) self-raising flour

½ tsp baking powder

Oil for cooking

Preheat the oven to 180C.

Place the caster sugar and 180ml water in a medium saucepan over low heat to allow the sugar to dissolve. Increase the heat and bring to the boil.

Place the berries in the hot syrup and heat them through. Strain the berries immediately, reserving the cooking liquid.

Return the cooking liquid to the saucepan and boil to reduce by half. Allow the syrup to cool a little, then add the berries. Set aside.

Beat the eggs and ricotta together. Add the milk, yoghurt and the extra two tbsp of caster sugar, and beat until smooth. Sift the flour with the baking powder and ½ tsp salt, and add to the ricotta base. Stir until combined – it should be quite thick.

Heat a heavy-based frying pan over medium-to-low heat. Add a splash of oil, then add ladlefuls of the ricotta mixture to form 7.5cm hotcakes. Cook until the bases are golden brown. Turn the hotcakes over and cook for a further 2–3 minutes.

Repeat until the mixture is used up, adding more oil as needed and keeping the cooked hotcakes warm in the oven.

This mixture makes at least 12 hotcakes. Serve the hotcakes with the poached raspberries on top.
