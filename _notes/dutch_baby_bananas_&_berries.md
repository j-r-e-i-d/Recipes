Ever out for breakfast and can’t work out whether you want to be good and get the fruit salad, or cut loose with the pancakes? Well, the answer is stay home and have the best of both worlds. One big pancake and loads of fruit to share, and it's ready in minutes.

## Ingredients
* 2 tbsp castor sugar
* 3 eggs
* 180ml milk
* 75g plain flour
* a pinch of salt
* 35g butter
* 2 bananas, peeled and sliced
* 2 cups mixed berries
* about 1/2 cup sour cream, to serve
* 2 tbsp icing sugar, to serve
* 1/4 cup maple syrup, to serve

## Method
Heat your oven to 220C and place a heavy, ovenproof frying pan (preferably cast iron and about 24 centimetres diameter) inside until very hot.

Beat the sugar, eggs and milk together until smooth.

Combine the flour and salt in a mixing bowl and make a well in the centre. Add the liquids a little at a time, whisking to a smooth batter.

Working quickly and carefully, add the butter to the pan and swirl the pan until it is well coated. Pour the batter into the buttered pan and return to the oven.

Bake for 15-20 minutes until the Dutch baby is golden brown and puffed like a large Yorkshire pudding.

Remove from the oven and scatter with the banana and berries and top with a big dollop of sour cream. Sieve over some icing sugar and serve immediately with maple syrup, as the pancake will deflate over time.
