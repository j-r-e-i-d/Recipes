You just cannot beat a pav in my book, and I glory in particular this dark beauty. The crisp and chewy chocolate meringue base, rich in cocoa and beaded nuggets of chopped plain chocolate, provides a sombre, almost purple-brown layer beneath the fat whiteness of the cream and matt, glowering crimson raspberries on top: it is a killer combination.

## Ingredients
**For the chocolate meringue**

6 large egg whites

* 300 grams caster sugar
* 3 tablespoons cocoa powder (sieved)
* 1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar (or red wine vinegar)
* 50 grams dark chocolate (finely chopped)

**For the topping**

* 500 millilitres double cream
* 500 grams raspberries
* 3 tablespoons dark chocolate (coarsely grated)

## Method

* Preheat the oven to 180째C/160째C Fan and line a baking tray with baking parchment.
* Beat the egg whites until satiny peaks form, and then beat in the sugar a spoonful at a time until the meringue is stiff and shiny. Sprinkle over the cocoa and vinegar, and the chopped chocolate. Then gently fold everything until the cocoa is thoroughly mixed in.
* Mound on to a baking sheet in a fat circle approximately 23cm / 9 inches in diameter, smoothing the sides and top. Place in the oven, then immediately turn the temperature down to 150째C/130째C Fan and cook for about one to one and a quarter hours. When it's ready it should look crisp around the edges and on the sides and be dry on top, but when you prod the centre you should feel the promise of squidginess beneath your fingers.
* Turn off the oven and open the door slightly, and let the chocolate meringue disc cool completely.
*  When you're ready to serve, invert on to a big, flat-bottomed plate. Whisk the cream till thick but still soft and pile it on top of the meringue, then scatter over the raspberries. 
* Coarsely grate the chocolate so that you get curls rather than rubble, as you don't want the raspberries' luscious colour and form to be obscured, and sprinkle haphazardly over the top, letting some fall, as it will, on the plate's rim.
