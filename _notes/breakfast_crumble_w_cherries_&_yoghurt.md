Rather than trying to bake first thing in the morning, you can prepare the elements for this crumble a day or two beforehand and just put them together in the morning. Very handy when you're feeding a crowd over Christmas!

## Ingredients

* 1kg cherries, pitted and halved
* ½ cup orange juice
* ¼ cup sugar
* 1kg Greek-style yoghurt

**Crumble topping**

* 1½ cups rolled oats
* 1 cup wholemeal flour
* 1 cup almond meal
* ½ cup chopped walnuts
* ¼ cup desiccated coconut
* ½ cup demerara sugar
* 100g butter, softened

## Method
Place half the cherries in a medium saucepan with the orange juice and sugar, bring to a simmer and cook until the cherries are softened and syrupy, about 20 minutes. Allow to cool to room temperature and then chill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. Gently fold the cherry mixture and the remaining cherries through the yoghurt, pack into a serving dish and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate until ready to serve. Heat your oven to 180°C.

For the crumble topping, combine all the Ingredients except the butter in a large bowl. Rub the softened butter through the dry Ingredients with your fingers to form a coarse crumble. Scatter the mixture over a lined baking sheet and bake until the crumble is golden brown, about 10-15 minutes. Allow to cool to room temperature then store in an airtight container until ready to serve. Scatter the cherry and yoghurt mixture with the crumble topping and serve.
