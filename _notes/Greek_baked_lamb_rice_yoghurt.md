Half moussaka, half shepherd's pie, this Greek/Albanian dish has a lush, custard-like topping of yoghurt and dill over a savoury lamb mince.

## Ingredients

1 onion, finely chopped
2 tbsp vegetable oil
1kg lamb, coarsely minced
2 garlic cloves, finely grated
3 tbsp rice, rinsed
1 tsp dried oregano
1 tsp ground cinnamon
2 tbsp tomato paste
2 spring onions, finely chopped
200ml vegetable stock or water
200g spinach leaves, washed

**For the topping**
500g Greek yoghurt
2 tbsp plain flour, sifted
2 tbsp dill, finely chopped
1 tsp sea salt
2 large eggs, well-beaten

## Method

1. Preheat the oven to 190C. In a frying pan, heat the oil and gently cook the onion until soft, then add the garlic. Add the lamb and fry until browned, breaking up the mince with a wooden spoon.
2. Add the rice, oregano, cinnamon, tomato paste, spring onions and the stock or water, and bring to the boil, stirring. Simmer for five minutes until the rice starts to absorb the liquid.
3. Fold in the spinach and toss for a minute or two until wilted. Transfer the meat and spinach to a lightly oiled baking dish, leaving room for the topping.
4. Whisk the yoghurt with the flour, dill and sea salt until smooth. Gradually whisk the mixture into the beaten eggs until smooth.
5. Pour the yoghurt mixture gently over the meat, and bake for 35 to 40 minutes until golden. Serve hot.
