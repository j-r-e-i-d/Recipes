# [Universal blue-cheese dressing](https://www.nigella.com/recipes/universally-useful-blue-cheese-dressing)


If you like blue cheese - as I, swooningly, do - then know that this, dribbled over sliced, sweet tomatoes along with a torn-off log of baguette is a perfect enough supper just as it is. And you can make a fabulously retro US-steakhouse-style starter, by cutting a head of iceberg lettuce into wedges and dolloping each crunchy wedge with the dressing followed by a scattering of crisp-fried bacon crumbles. And it makes a fabulous sauce for leftover rare roast beef. It’s obviously divine with baked potatoes, too, and should you want just to eat as a dip with chips or crudités, please know that I fully support you in this!
