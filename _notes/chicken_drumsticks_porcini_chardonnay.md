# [Chicken drumsticks with porcini and chardonnay](Chicken drumsticks with porcini and chardonnay)

This is a simplified version of the classic French poulet au vin jaune. Drumsticks braised in porcini stock, mushrooms and chardonnay. Itâ€™s spiked with a little brandy too, and finished with cream. Truly delicious.

Serves 4

## Ingredients

20 g dried porcini mushrooms

2 tbsp vegetable oil

8 Lilydale free-range chicken drumsticks

salt, to season

50 g butter

1 large onion, peeled and diced

4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced

250 g sliced Swiss brown mushrooms

4 bay leaves

6 sprigs thyme

250 ml chardonnay

2 tbsp brandy

150 ml thickened cream

1 tsp finely shredded parsley leaves

## Method

Cover the porcini mushrooms in 2 cups of hot water and stand for 15 minutes. Heat a large chef pan over high heat and add the oil. Fry the drumsticks in batches until well-browned, then remove from the pan.

Add the butter to the pan and fry the onion for about 3 minutes until fragrant. Add the garlic and mushrooms and fry for about 5 minutes until the mushrooms are lightly browned. Add the porcini to the pan with the other mushrooms and return the drumsticks to the pan along with the herbs. Cover with the porcini steeping liquid, wine, brandy and top up with a little more water to cover the drumsticks. Bring to a simmer, cover and simmer for 40 minutes, stirring once or twice. Add the cream and simmer for a further 10 minutes uncovered. Taste and adjust seasoning. Scatter with parsley. Serve with crusty bread and a green salad.
