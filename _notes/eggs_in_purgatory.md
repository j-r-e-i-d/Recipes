You don’t actually need to have a hangover to enjoy this for breakfast (or anytime), but there is something about this easy and quick dish of eggs cooked in a fiery tomato sauce that just hits the spot when you're in need of morning-after succour.

## Ingredients

Serves: 1

* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 1 small clove garlic (peeled)
* ¼ teaspoon dried chilli flakes
* 1 x 400 grams can chopped tomatoes
* ½ teaspoon sea salt flakes (or to taste)
* 1 large egg (or 2 eggs if needed)
* 2 teaspoons grated parmesan (or more as needed)
* 1 splash of chilli oil (optional to serve)
* 2 slices white bread (or other bread of your choice to serve)

## Method
Pour the olive oil into a frying pan, then grate in (or mince and add) the garlic, scatter in the chilli flakes and put the pan over a medium heat, stirring, for 1 minute.Tip in the tomatoes, stir in the salt, and let it come to a bubble. It’s got to be hot enough to poach an egg in.Crack in the egg (or eggs), sprinkle the Parmesan over it, leaving some of the yellow yolk still exposed, and partially cover with a lid. Let it bubble for 5 minutes, by which time the white should be set and the yolk still runny, but keep an eye on it.Remove from the heat and serve – if so wished – sprinkled with a little more Parmesan and some chilli oil, and some bread to dunk in.
