## Ingredients

* 210g unsalted butter, softened
* 165g (¾ cup) castor sugar
* 2 tsp vanilla extract
* 200g flaked almonds
* 2 tbsp milk
* 225g (1¾ cup) plain flour
* 40g (⅓ cup) cornflour
* 160g raspberry jam

Preheat the oven to 180°C and lightly grease a 24-centimetre x 20-centimetre tin and line it with baking paper.

To make the almond topping, put 60 grams of the butter, 55 grams (¼ cup) of the sugar, one teaspoon of the vanilla extract, the almonds and the milk in a saucepan. Cook over a very low heat until the butter has melted, then turn off the heat and leave to cool.

To make the base, use an electric beater on low speed to cream the remaining butter, sugar and vanilla extract until pale and smooth. Sift the flour and cornflour together and add to the butter/sugar mixture in two separate batches, beating on low speed until just mixed.

Press the dough into the baking tray and bake for 12 minutes, or until lightly golden. Remove from the oven and leave to cool for 10 minutes. Carefully spread the jam over the pastry base, then spread the cooled almond topping over the jam. Return to the oven and bake for a further 25 minutes or until golden brown.
