## Ingredients

300g button mushrooms, sliced
¼ cup olive oil
2 brown onions, diced
2 cloves garlic, roughly chopped
1 zucchini, grated
280g baby spinach
salt and black pepper, to season
12 eggs
100ml sour cream
½ cup grated tasty cheese
½ cup grated parmesan

## Method

1. Heat your oven to 200C fan-forced (220C conventional). Microwave the mushrooms uncovered for 5 minutes. Heat a 25cm frying pan over medium heat and add the oil. Fry the onions and garlic for 5 minutes until the onion starts to brown. Add the microwaved mushrooms and zucchini and fry for about 4 minutes until the mushrooms are lightly browned. Add the spinach in 2-3 batches and stir until wilted. Season well with salt and pepper.

2. While the mushroom mix is cooking, whisk the eggs, sour cream and cheeses together until well combined. Add about half of the egg mixture to the pan and stir with a spatula to distribute the vegetables evenly, moving the egg gently from the outside to the centre as if making scrambled eggs. Spread the mixture over the pan evenly and add the remaining egg mixture. Cover and cook for about 6 minutes over low heat, then uncover and transfer to the oven for 5-10 minutes. Watch and remove when the egg is set and still very slightly jiggly in the centre. Allow to cool for a few minutes at least before slicing. This dish can be served warm, at room temperature, or cold.
