A set custard is always a crowd pleaser. If you're worried about turning this out as a set dessert (like creme caramel), skip that step. They're just as good – and just as good-looking – when served in an attractive ramekin.

## Ingredients

400g ripe apricots, peeled and cut into chunks
1 x 375ml can evaporated milk
5 eggs
1 x 395g can condensed milk
½ tsp vanilla extract
¾ cup sugar
150ml thickened cream, to serve
cinnamon, to serve

## Method

Peel and de-seed the apricots and combine in a blender with the evaporated milk. Blend to a smooth consistency.

Beat the eggs and whisk with the condensed milk and vanilla extract. Add the apricot mixture and whisk to combine, then strain the mixture into a jug.

Heat your oven to 170C.

Heat the sugar in a small saucepan over medium heat until it becomes a dark caramel. Pour the caramel into six 1-cup-capacity ramekins. Allow to harden, then fill the ramekins with the custard mix, leaving about 1cm at the top of each.

Place a wet tea towel inside a large baking dish, then place the ramekins on top. Pour boiling water into the baking dish until it comes halfway up the side of the ramekins. Place in oven and bake for 30 minutes or until the custards are just barely cooked through to the centre.

Allow to cool to room temperature, then chill in the fridge for at least 1 hour. To serve, top each one with some cream and sprinkle with cinnamon.

**Tip:** These custardy puddings are easy to transport and are a welcome finale to a meaty meal, such as [sausages with cabbage and mustard salad](https://www.goodfood.com.au/recipes/barbecued-sausages-with-red-cabbage-and-mustard-salad-recipe-20180205-h0uenw).
