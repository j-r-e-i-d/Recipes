The dough for these scones is pretty standard: rub the butter into flour augmented with a raising agent, then add a little milk and roll out. Here I use a combination of cream of tartar and baking soda, so it is a bit less zingy on the tongue. Then instead of being cooked in the oven, like a normal scone, they are cooked on a heavy griddle or in a heavy cast-iron pan. This gives them a wonderful crisp, golden and slightly buttery outside that is absolutely delicious.

_Makes 9_

## Ingredients
* 225g plain flour
* 1 tsp cream of tartar
* ½ tsp baking soda
* 85g unsalted butter, chilled and cut into cubes (with a little extra for the cooking process)
* 60g raisins or currants
* 2 tbsp castor sugar
* ½ cup whole milk

## Method

Over low heat on the stovetop, preheat a heavy pan or griddle.

In a large bowl, sift together the flour, cream of tartar and baking soda.

Using your fingertips, rub the cubes of butter into the dry ingredients until large, cornflake-sized pieces remain.

Stir in the raisins or currants and then the sugar.

Add enough of the milk to form a soft dough. If you end up needing a little more milk than the half-cup indicated to achieve this, add a splash more.

Turn the dough onto a lightly floured bench top and roll out into a one-centimetre-thick circle.

Cut into rounds with a six-centimetre cutter. You should get nine scones.

Check that the griddle (or pan) is now hot, then use a small knob of butter to grease the entire cooking surface.

Place the scones on the griddle and turn the heat to the lowest possible setting. This way the scones will cook all the way through without browning too much on the outside.

Cook the scones until they are a rich brown on the bottom (about eight to 10 minutes). If you feel they are too dry, add a little more butter to the griddle as they cook.

Use a spatula to flip the scones over and continue to cook on the other side until they are no longer doughy in the centre (another 10 to 15 minutes).

Rotate the scones on the griddle as they cook, as certain areas of the plate’s surface may be hotter than others. Keep adding dots of butter for flavour. If you rotate the scones as they cook, you should be able to avoid uneven colouring.

Remove from the griddle to a platter and let the scones cool for a few minutes before serving.

Serve with butter, honey or jam.
