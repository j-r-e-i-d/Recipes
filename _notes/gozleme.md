You'll need to begin this recipe 1 day ahead

## Ingredients
**Dough**

* 2 cups (300 g) unbleached plain flour, plus extra to dust
* 2 cups (320 g) wholemeal flour
* 1 tsp salt
* lukewarm water
* ½ cup vegetable oil e.g.canola

**Filling**

* 2 cups (200 g) grated feta (or a mixture of feta and mozzarella, cheddar or ricotta)
* 2 cups silverbeet or spinach leaves, finely chopped and stems removed
* ½ cup fresh mint leaves, chopped
* ½ cup flat leaf parsley, chopped
* ½ cup spring onion, chopped
* ½ cup brown onion, diced
* 1 tsp white pepper
* 1 tsp allspice
* 1 tsp mixed dried herbs, such as oregano and sage

## Method

1. To make the dough, sift the flours and salt. Mix with 1½ cups water in an electric stand mixer with a dough hook attachment, or knead by hand for at least 10 minutes.
2. Keep adding more water, a little at a time, until you get a very pliable, elastic dough that is easy to knead, but not so watery that it is too sticky to handle. Rubber gloves dusted in flour make the handling easier. Dust frequently with the extra flour.
3. Allow the dough to prove, covered, overnight (at least 10 hours).
4. When ready to cook, divide the dough into six round portions. Dust with flour.
5. Dust a work surface with flour and roll one of the rounds flat with a rolling pin, into a rectangle shape as thinly as possible.
6. Sprinkle on about 1 tsp of oil, then fold over into a square. Fold over twice more into a square. Repeat the dusting, rolling out to a large rectangle, folding, oiling, dusting process three more times.
7. Repeat the entire process for each of the six rounds. You should end up with six neatly folded, labour-intensive squares!
8. To fill and cook the gozleme, take one of the folded dough squares and roll it out very thinly for the final time, into a large square.
9. Sprinkle on the filling sparingly, as you would for a pizza topping, but on half of the square only. Start with a layer of cheese. Mix the silverbeet, mint, parsley and spring onion together in a bowl, and add some of this as the next layer. Top with some of the herb-spice-onion mixture.
10. If desired, add a little of the cooked savoury minced lamb mixture, as the last layer. (To prepare the lamb, pan-fry the mince in a little oil until browned, add the other Ingredients and continue cooking until the carrot has softened. Add the tomato juice as the mixture begins to dry out. Continue to cook on a low heat for another 5 minutes.)
11. Fold over the uncovered half of the square to cover the filling. Press down lightly all over. Cook on pre-heated oiled barbecue hot plate or large frying pan, but not too hot, because it should take about 10 minutes to cook through, without burning. Turn often. Cut into smaller squares and serve with lemon wedges
