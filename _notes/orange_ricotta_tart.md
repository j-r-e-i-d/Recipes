![](assets/143a09a8e60d90a82d2f67a72f462df2.png)
*Serves 6 to 8*

## Ingredients

* 350g plain flour
* 250g unsalted butter
* 60g caster sugar
* 1 egg yolk, lightly whisked with 30g water filling
* 1 large egg
* 1 large egg yolk
* 250g ricotta, drained
* 75g icing sugar
* 2 tsp finely grated orange zest
* 1 tbsp Grand Marnier or orange liqueur
* 125ml double cream, plus extra to serve
 

**For the tart base,** lightly grease a 25cm tart pan with a removable base.

**To make the pastry,** process the flour, butter and sugar together in a food processor until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. Add the whisked egg yolk and water to the food processor and process until the mixture just comes together. Using your hands, form the mixture into a ball, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes.

**Roll out the pastry** onto a lightly floured work surface to 5mm thick. Line the prepared tart pan with the pastry and trim the edges. Cover and refrigerate for a further 30 minutes.

**Preheat the oven** to 180Â°C. Cover the pastry case with parchment paper and fill with baking weights (dried beans or rice). Bake for 15 minutes until pale golden brown. Remove the weights and set aside.

**For the filling,** place the egg, egg yolk, ricotta, sugar, orange zest and liqueur in a medium bowl and stir to combine. Whip the cream in a small bowl with an electric mixer on high speed until soft peaks form. Fold the cream into the ricotta mixture and spoon into the prepared tart case.

**Bake for 20 minutes** or until golden. Allow tart to cool on a wire rack. Serve with extra double cream, if desired. The orange ricotta tart is also fantastic served simply with vanilla ice-cream.
