Serves 6 – 8

## Ingredients

8 Large tomatoes

200g Le Ménez Hom, or some other goat’s cheese (grated or crumbled)

200g of lardons, or chopped pancetta, or smoked streaky bacon

Salt & Pepper

For the pastry:

175g plain flour, plus extra for dusting

85g chilled butter, cut into cubes

## Method

Preheat the oven to 200ºC 

Tip the flour into a large mixing bowl. Add the butter and rub in gently with fingertips until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs.

Add 3 tablespoons cold water until the pastry comes together in a ball.

Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface and use it to line a 20cm quiche dish.

Line the base and sides with baking parchment and weigh it down with baking beans.

Place on a baking sheet and bake for 10 minutes.

Remove the baking parchment and baking beans and bake for a further 10 minutes.

Set to one side.

Deseed and slice the tomatoes, and layer on the bottom of the tart.

Scatter the lardons on top of the tomatoes, and crumble the cheese over the tart.

Cook for 15 minutes, and then garnish with some chopped rocket from the garden (or the supermarket).

Enjoy with Salad and a cool crisp glass of Cabernet D’Anjou rosé.
