-   400g quality butter, cold and cubed

### Green Beans

-   1 small shallot 
-   1 tin quality anchovies 
-   1 tbsp drained capers
-   3 sprigs parsley
-   2 sprigs tarragon
-   60ml extra virgin olive oil
-   1 tbsp champagne vinegar 
-   1 lemon, zested and juiced
-   250g green and yellow beans, trimmed

### Fish en Papillote

-   6 sprigs parsley
-   6 x 200g skinless barramundi fillets, bones removed
-   6 thick slices lemon, skin and pith removed, cut in half
-   60g good quality butter
-   12 sprigs thyme
-   extra virgin olive oil

### To season

-   salt flakes and pepper

## Steps

-   Preheat oven to 190°C fan-forced. Bring a medium saucepan of salted water to the boil then remove from the heat. Prepare an ice bath.
-   For the Pomme Purée , cut potatoes into quarters and place them into a heavy based saucepan. Cover with water and season generously with salt. Simmer until potatoes are fork tender. Drain and set aside to cool slightly. Push the potatoes through a fine sieve, then repeat the process again. Return to the saucepan and place over a very low heat. Slowly whisk in the warm milk. Remove from the heat and add the butter a few pieces at a time, until combined, glossy and smooth. Season with salt, to taste.
-   Cover the surface with baking paper to avoid a skin from forming and keep warm until ready to serve.
-   For the Green Beans, finely dice the shallot, anchovies, capers, tarragon, parsley and place into a medium bowl. Combine the olive oil, vinegar, oil from the anchovies, lemon zest and juice in a small bowl and set aside.
-   When ready to serve, cook the trimmed beans in the boiling water for 1 ½ minutes. Transfer to the ice bath for a few seconds. Drain the beans and place into the bowl with the shallot mixture. Add the dressing and toss the beans through the mixture until well coated. Season to taste. Set aside.
-   For the Fish en Papillote, cut 12 A5 sized pieces of foil. Arrange on bench in six stacks of two layers, shiny side up. Top each with 1 slightly smaller piece of baking paper. Tear parsley leaves into small pieces and sprinkle over the paper to create a bed for the fish. Season fish with salt on both sides and place onto parsley.
-   Top each portion of fish with lemon, a slice of butter and thyme. Drizzle lightly with olive oil. Cover each piece of fish with 2 more pieces of foil, dull side up. Fold the edges of foil in towards the fish, one side at a time, ensuring edges are sealed tight but there is still enough space in the centre of the parcel to expand as the fish cooks. Place onto a tray and cook in the oven for 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and set aside for 5 minutes.
-   To serve, cut open the fish parcels and carefully slide onto serving plates. Add a large spoonful of the puree and dressed beans to the plate, along with some extra dressing. Sprinkle with salt flakes.
