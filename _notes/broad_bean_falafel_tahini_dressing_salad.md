The most interesting ingredient in this recipe, however, is the sea parsley. Sea parsley (or sea celery) is a coastal native plant that is closely related to our more common parsleys. It grows along the coast, protruding from rocky outcrops and cliff faces. Sea parsley was eaten by early explorers, including Captain Cook, to ward off scurvy. Propagated varieties can be used in the same manner as continental parsley but with more restraint. Don’t be intimidated – endeavour to experiment with the native alternative.

 Ingredients
Serves 4

**Falafel**

300g dried broad beans
500g fresh broad beans (shelled)
¼ cup sea parsley
¼ tsp ground cumin
¼ tsp ground coriander seeds
⅛ tsp white pepper
1 clove garlic, grated (with microplane)
1 shallot
salt
1 litre rice bran oil or other frying oil
Tahini dressing

200ml Greek-style yoghurt
20ml tahini
20ml lemon juice
salt

**Salad**
1 bunch continental parsley
100g broad beans (shelled)
1 shallot
10ml lemon juice
20ml olive oil
salt

## Method

Soak the dried broad beans in two litres of water overnight. Strain off the water, combine the beans with the rest of the falafel ingredients (except the oil) in a food processor and pulse until the mixture becomes a mealy paste. Reserve in a bowl to be fried.
Combine the yoghurt, tahini and lemon juice in a food processor and blend until the mixture becomes a smooth paste. Season with salt and reserve.
Roughly chop both the continental parsley and the broad beans. Peel and finely slice the shallot and mix the ingredients together. Dress with the lemon juice and olive oil and season to taste.
Bring the frying oil up to 180ºC and form the falafel using a spoon to compact the mixture into small balls. Using your finger, flick the falafel from the end of the spoon into the oil and fry for three minutes. Lift the falafel out of the oil and place onto absorbent paper.
Smear the tahini dressing on the base of a plate, followed by the salad. Place the falafel on top and serve with flatbread as a meal, or enjoy as a warm salad.
