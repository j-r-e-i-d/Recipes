## Ingredients

- 600g lamb and mint sausages, cases removed
- 200g feta, crumbled
- 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
- 8 medium flatbreads
- 1 cup (280g) natural Greek-style yoghurt
- 1 Lebanese cucumber, sliced into ribbons
- 1 red onion, thinly sliced
- 1 cup flat-leaf parsley leaves
- cracked black pepper, for sprinkling

## Method

1. Place the sausage meat and half the feta in a large bowl and mix to combine.
2. Roll tablespoonfuls of the mixture into balls.
3. Heat the oil in a large, non-stick frying pan over medium heat. Cook the meatballs for 12â€“14 minutes or until browned and cooked through.
4. Top the flatbreads with the yoghurt, meatballs, cucumber, onion, parsley and remaining feta. Sprinkle with pepper to serve. Serves 4.

*TIPS:*

*+ The meatballs can be made in advance and frozen raw. Thaw completely before cooking.*

*+ You can swap the mince in these recipes for any of your favourite sausages. Just remove the meat from the casings before using.*
