Time: 30 mins - 1 hour
*Serves: 4*

Grilled chicken with salt, pepper and lime dipping sauce. 

Thai chillies, perhaps more commonly referred to as bird's eye, are not for the faint-hearted so use to taste (!) in this quick chicken dish, suitable for a dinner party gathering.

## Ingredients

* 1kg chicken thigh fillets, skin on, well-trimmed
* sea salt
* white pepper
* Thai chillies, thinly sliced  (available at Asian food shops and some greengrocers)
* lime wedges

**For the marinade**

* ¼ tsp sugar
* ½ tsp salt
* 1½ tsp black pepper
* 1 tbsp fish sauce
* 1 tbsp fresh lime juice
* 2 tbsp vegetable oil

**1.**  Combine all the marinade Ingredients and mix well. Immerse chicken in the marinade, cover and refrigerate for two hours.

**2.**  Remove the chicken from the refrigerator 30 minutes before grilling. Preheat the grill to medium. Place the chicken on the grill, skin side down initially. Cook for about 10-12 minutes, turning regularly to stop chicken burning. Remove and rest for five minutes.

**3.**  Place salt, pepper and chillies in little bowls next to each guest. Cut chicken into slices and place on a plate with the lime wedges.

**4.**  Each guest should place some salt and white pepper into their dipping sauce dish (two-parts salt to one-part pepper is a good start). Next, add a squeeze of lime. Finally, use chopsticks to muddle some chilli slices in the mixture to release their oils.

**To serve:** Dip each bite of chicken into the sauce just before eating.
