**Ingredients**

_Serves 2-3_

Time: 15 minutes preparation + cooking

-   1 whole egg
-   4 egg yolks
-   50g castor sugar
-   30g plain flour, sifted
-   10g cocoa powder, sifted
-   1 tsp ground cardamom
-   ½ tsp ground black pepper
-   good pinch cooking salt
-   pinch of cocoa nibs (optional)
-   pouring cream to serve

**Method**

1.  Preheat your oven to 220°C.
2.  Whisk together your eggs and sugar in an electric mixer until pale and doubled in size (about one-and-a-half minutes).
3.  Gently fold in the flour and then the cocoa powder, spices and salt until fully incorporated.
4.  Pour the mixture into a small baking dish or bowl. It can be quite shallow as the mix only needs to come up about 1.5 centimetres from the bottom.
5.  Bake for seven to eight minutes.
6.  Let it cool to room temperature and serve sparingly sprinkled with cocoa nibs and swimming in cream.
