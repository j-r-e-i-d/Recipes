The combination of bananas, condensed milk and crepes is a favourite Thai street food. Often served as crisp packages, this more classic French crepe style uses less oil and is a little easier to make.

## Ingredients

**For the crepes**
500ml milk
3 eggs
275g plain flour
25g butter, plus extra for cooking

**For the topping**
25g butter
2 ripe bananas, cut into 1cm slices
2 tbsp golden syrup
condensed milk, to serve

Method

1. For the crepes, combine the milk, eggs, flour and butter (in that order) in a blender and blend to a smooth batter. Heat a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and brush with a little butter. Pour a thin layer of batter into the pan and cook for 1-2 minutes until set. Flip and cook for a further minute, them remove to plate and cover with a tea towel. Repeat for the remaining crepes. 

2. Once you have cooked all the crepes, add the butter for the topping into the pan and fry the bananas for about 4 minutes, drizzling with the golden syrup to caramelise. Top the crepes with the bananas, and drizzle generously with condensed milk to serve.

**Adam's tip** The method for how you make your crepes will determine their texture. Using a blender cuts gluten strands and will give you a fluffier crepe, but mixing by hand will develop more gluten for a crepe that is more elastic.
